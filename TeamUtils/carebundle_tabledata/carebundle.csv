M,AA001,Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm - Endovascular Repair,AAA |  Endovascular Repair | Aortic Aneurysm | Aneurysm | Aorta | Rupture | Bulging,https://client.myoptumhealth.com/myoptumhealth/guest/page.esync?view=prelogin.learn.learnLanding&command=DiseasesAndConditions&article=7644d666b1259110VgnVCM1000005220720a____#.U0wThAUxD6U.email,"An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a dilation (bulging) in a section of the wall of the abdominal part of the aorta (the main artery in your body).  It is generally defined as a bulging of one and a half times the normal diameter of the aorta or a diameter greater than or equal to 3 cm or 1.2 inches.  As the aorta continues to enlarge over time, the risk that a life threatening rupture causing massive bleeding could occur increases. There are two ways to repair an aortic aneurysm.
> An endovascular repair is a newer surgical procedure that is done through a small incision made in the groin.  A catheter (hollow tube) is inserted into the large artery in the groin  and threaded up to the aorta.  Using special x-rays, a collapsible tube (stent) is inserted into the aorta and expanded at the site of the aneurysm.  
> An open repair is a traditional surgery for repair of an AAA.  This surgery is done through a large incision made in the abdomen, usually from top to bottom (vertical incision).  A special graft (tube) is used to replace the weakened area of the aorta.  This surgery has been done for many years. The need for additional surgery is rare.  
> The size and shape of the aneurysm, as well as the condition of the arteries around the aneurysm, all determine whether a person is suitable for an endovascular repair.
This care path includes the costs for an endovascular repair.
","The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends a one-time ultrasound screening for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) if you are a male between 65 to 75 years old and have ever smoked.  Early diagnosis and treatment of an AAA can decrease complications and increase the chance of survival.  Most people who have an AAA have no symptoms, so many aren't discovered until they have ruptured. 
> If you are younger than 65 years old, are female or have never smoked, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes that there is insufficient evidence that screening for AAA in persons without symptoms has any medical benefit.
> If you're diagnosed with an AAA, but have no symptoms, the decision on how and when to treat it is based on the size of the aneurysm, your age, your current health and medical history, and your risk for complications. 
> Symptoms related to an AAA may indicate the aneurysm is enlarging or about to rupture.  These symptoms include abdominal or back pain that is constant and may be severe, a feeling of abdominal fullness, or a pulsating abdominal mass.  
> Symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm include sudden severe abdominal or back pain, nausea and vomiting, low blood pressure, rapid pulse, or pale and clammy skin. This is a medical emergency, and requires immediate medical attention.

Risk factors for an AAA include increased age, sex (men have a much higher risk), family history, personal history of aneurysms in other arteries, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and hardening of the arteries.  Your medical history can help determine if you have an increased risk for an AAA, but a physical examination may not be reliable unless you have a pulsating abdominal mass.  This is especially true if you have no symptoms or are overweight.  An AAA is often found on an imaging study (CT scan, x-ray, or ultrasound) that was done for an AAA screening or other unrelated reasons.  
> Aneurysms less than 5.5 cm may be watched closely to see if they are growing.  The larger the aneurysm, the higher the risk for rupture. 
> There's no proven treatment to stop an aneurysm from growing, but your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to lower your heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol.
> Tobacco products and secondhand smoke harm the heart, blood vessels, circulation, and other parts of the body.  Smokers will be encouraged to quit and avoid secondhand smoke. 

If your healthcare provider recommends a repair of your AAA, prior to surgery tell him or her about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery.  These may include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners 
> regular medications you should take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.  

During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia is the most common type of anesthesia for an open AAA repair.  With this type of anesthesia, you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
> Either local, spinal, or general anesthesia are possible for an endovascular AAA repair.   
You will spend a few of days in the hospital after surgery.  You may need pain medication and help at home while you recover.","The most serious complication of an aneurysm is a rupture, which is a medical emergency that can lead to hemorrhage and death if not treated immediately. 
> Lower mortality rates and fewer postoperative complications occur in people who have a planned surgery at a hospital that does a large number of AAA repairs.  The death rate after surgery is much higher if you have symptoms before surgery or your aneurysm has ruptured.
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and various infections.  
> An endovascular repair is less invasive, has fewer postoperative complications, a shorter hospital stay, and quicker recovery when compared to an open surgical repair. 
> Risks specific to an endovascular repair include leaking around the stent graft (endoleaks), which may require a second procedure, and damage to the femoral artery, the large artery in your groin.  Also, lifetime follow up with annual x-rays, CT scans, or ultrasounds is recommended to monitor the graft for leakage. 
> Risks specific to an open repair include bleeding, infection, a longer hospital stay, and a longer recovery time than endovascular repair. 
> Rates of survival are similar following an endovascular repair and an open surgical repair. ","If you have any symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, make an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your options.  If you have symptoms of rupture of an AAA, as described above, you must seek medical attention immediately. 
 Ask your healthcare provider the following questions.  
> Am I at risk for developing an aneurysm?  How can I decrease my risk? 
> Do I have an aneurysm?  How large is it and what are my treatment options? 
> Can my symptoms be controlled with medications?  If so, are their Tier 1 or Tier 2 medications on my Prescription Drug List that I should take?
> Do I need any special tests?  What are the benefits and risks of having the tests?  
> Will the tests change your treatment recommendations?  If not, is there a need for them?
> What are the benefits and risks of an endovascular repair versus an open repair? 
> Is one type of surgery a better option over the other for me? Why or why not? 
> What symptoms are normal after the procedure? When should I be concerned? 
> How long after surgery should I follow-up with you?",34802,This is the repair of a bulging weak area of the aorta through a small incision made in the groin.,Complex,Inpatient,Hospital,,,Heart and Circulation,441.4,I71.4 ,,,

They are called bronchial tubes. This type of bronchitis usually occurs after a recent respiratory virus; bacterial infection (less common); or exposure to chemicals, dust or fumes.  
> Acute bronchitis is more common than chronic bronchitis, which is considered a form of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).  COPD is a condition that is most often the result of chronic smoking.  
> Acute bronchitis can also develop when stomach acids back up into the throat and damage the tissue.  This is called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD.
> Bronchitis often occurs after a cold and is most common in the winter.","Most cases of bronchitis are caused by a virus.  People who have a virus can spread it by coughing, sneezing, or touching a surface or object. Others may “catch” this virus if they breathe in the infected droplets or touch the infected surface, and then touch their noses or mouths. The most common symptoms of acute bronchitis are:
> cough (sputum may be discolored)
> low-grade fever (typically less than 100 degrees)
> feeling ill or general malaise
For treatment, make sure to get plenty of rest and drink an adequate amount of fluids. Also avoid cigarette smoke and other respiratory irritants.  Your health care provider may order an antiviral, antibiotic, or over-the-counter medication for you.
> Most coughs should go away in a couple of weeks.  If your symptoms continue or get worse, you may have developed a bacterial infection (secondary infection).  
> Antibiotics are not effective against viruses and the overuse of antibiotics can result in bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics.
> One of the best ways to prevent getting sick is to avoid others who are coughing a great deal. 
> One of the best ways to avoid making others sick is to cover your mouth when you cough and to wash your hands frequently!","People have a higher risk of developing bronchitis if they smoke or have other chronic medical conditions. Chronic conditions include a weak immune system, asthma, and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). 
> The most common complication of acute bronchitis is a post-bronchitis cough. This type of cough usually goes away in 1 to 3 months, but can last up to 6 months.  
> People who have been diagnosed with acute bronchitis may have blood-streaked mucous or get a secondary infection (a new infection on top of the old one).
To decrease the likelihood of bronchitis you can take these steps.  
> If you smoke, stop!  Also, avoid secondhand smoke.  
> Wear a mask or respirator if you work with chemicals, dust, or other respiratory irritants.  
> Avoid exposure to anyone who has a cold or the flu.

Smoking is by far the most common cause of COPD.  However, there are also occupational causes of COPD.  In addition, one type of COPD is caused by a genetic disorder. 
> People with COPD may have emphysema (destruction of lung tissue, especially the walls of the air sacs in the lungs) and/or chronic bronchitis (inflammation of the air passages in the lungs that leads to increased amounts of mucous and a chronic cough).  Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, though many people have more of one of these conditions than the other.
> COPD is a progressive condition, meaning the blockage and destruction of the lung tissue increases with time, which leads to worsening symptoms.
","Cigarette smoking is the greatest risk factor for developing COPD, accounting for up to 90 percent of all cases.  The inflammation, caused by smoking and other irritants associated with COPD, leads to changes in the lungs that worsen over time.  This leads to increased mucus production and thickening of the lining of the airways.  The mucus and thickening eventually limit the flow of air into and out of the lungs.  As previously noted, in people with emphysema destruction of lung tissue also occurs.  This makes the work of breathing much harder as the disease progresses.
> Other risk factors for COPD include exposure to occupational dust and chemicals and indoor and outdoor air pollution. 
> Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a rare hereditary condition, can cause emphysema in nonsmokers.  If you have this deficiency and you smoke, you have an even greater risk of developing emphysema than someone with the deficiency who does not smoke. 

Because symptoms of COPD usually develop over a long period of time, early in the course of the disease people do not always know they have the condition.  Some of the symptoms of COPD may include:
> shortness of breath (dyspnea) or difficulty “catching” your breath, especially with any exertion
> wheezing 
> a chronic cough, often associated with mucus production
> tiredness
> frequent respiratory infections
> chest tightness 

If you have symptoms of COPD, you should contact your healthcare provider.  He or she will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam that focuses on examining your chest.  Your healthcare provider may also recommend tests to see how well your lungs are working.  
< Spirometry is a test used to measure airflow and lung volume.  It can help determine the severity of COPD and monitor its progression. 
> Sometimes, spirometry is done before and after certain medications (bronchodilators) are given.  This measures how reversible the lung condition might be.
> Arterial blood gas measurement is a blood test that measures the level of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood.
> Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency screening is a test to see if someone is at high risk for COPD because of a deficiency of this enzyme.
> Exercise studies may be done to see how an individual with COPD handles varying degrees of exercise.  
> Chest x-rays are frequently done at the time of diagnosis, for a baseline, and during periods of worsening symptoms to rule out pneumonia or other lung diseases. 

Although there is no cure for COPD, there are things you can do to better manage your symptoms and stop the damage to your lungs.
> If you smoke, it is critical that you stop smoking.  You should also avoid secondhand smoke as much as you can.  
> Make lifestyle changes, such as avoiding cold air, eliminating fireplace smoke and other irritating fumes or chemicals, exercising as tolerated and recommended by your healthcare provider, and eating a healthy diet.
> If you are overweight or obese, weight loss can be very helpful.
If your symptoms interfere with your daily activities, your healthcare provider may prescribe one of several medications, a nebulizer, and/or oxygen to help improve your breathing and how well you function. 
> The main goal of the medications is usually to decrease the inflammation in your lungs and open up the airways.
> Antibiotics may be needed if you develop a bacterial respiratory infection.
> If your work involves exposure to lung irritants, you can work with your employer to reduce that exposure, which might involve the use of special protective equipment.","COPD is a chronic, progressive disease that does not currently have a cure.  Although the symptoms of COPD can get better with treatment, they will worsen a lot faster if you continue to smoke or are exposed to irritants or other factors that aggravate the condition.  Severe COPD can lead to frequent hospitalizations and severe limits on activity and overall function.  Some of the complications of COPD can include:
> need for breathing machine and oxygen therapy
> heart failure 
> pneumonia
> collapse of the lung
","Make an appointment with your healthcare provider if you are at high risk or have symptoms of COPD.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.  If you are a smoker, asking about smoking cessation programs in your area and other options to stop smoking.

This can lead to chest tightness, wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing (shortness of breath).  Asthma is a chronic condition, meaning the symptoms can continue over a long period of time, possibly throughout a person's life.  The symptoms can range from minimal and well controlled to severe.  Severe symptoms are frequently known as an “asthma attack.”  Asthma attacks are often caused by one or more triggers.  Some common triggers are:
> exposure to animal hair or dander in people who are allergic
> exposure to dust, mold, and pollen in people who are allergic
> exercise, particularly in cold weather
> weather changes (especially cold weather)
> exposure to various chemicals in the air or food, especially cigarette smoke
> respiratory infections
> stress or other emotions
> in some people, aspirin and other NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)","Asthma symptoms are the result of constriction and inflammation of the airways, but it the exact cause is not always known.  People with a personal or family history of allergies (such as hay fever or eczema) seem to develop asthma more often.  However, there are people with asthma who have no personal or family history of allergies.  Some of the common symptoms of asthma include:
> a dry or moist cough 
> difficulty breathing 
> wheezing
> chest tightness
> trouble sleeping due to wheezing or shortness of breath
Emergency symptoms include blue skin or lips, sleepiness or confusion, extreme shortness of breath (especially at rest), fast heart rate, severe anxiety, and sweating.  These symptoms require immediate treatment by a doctor.

If you have symptoms of asthma, you should contact your healthcare provider.  They will take a medical history and do a physical exam that focuses on your chest, and upper airways (mouth, nose and throat).  They may also recommend some tests to see how well your lungs are working.  
< A peak flow meter is a small, easy to use, device that you can use at home.  It measures how much force you generate when you breath out (exhale) into the device as hard as you can.  This is your peak flow rate.  The measurements are recorded in a log so you can track your readings and look for any important fluctuations or changes.  Knowing your baseline readings can help you see early warnings that your asthma may be flaring up, even before you have symptoms.  Thus, timely treatment can be started. 
> Allergy testing can help determine triggers in people who have allergies.
> Lung function tests can measure how well your lungs are working and how well they are responding to treatment.
> Arterial blood gas measurement is a blood test that measures the level of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood.  It can determine how much your asthma is interfering with the flow of air going into your lungs.  Blood gas measurement are most often done during more severe asthma attacks.
> Chest x-rays may be done to rule out infection or other disorders.

Although there is no cure for asthma, there are things you can do to control the changes in your airways and manage your symptoms.
> Have a written action plan so you and others know what to do if you have an asthma attack.  An action plan should include what your usual symptoms are, what your normal peak flow measurement is, what you triggers are, and what works best to help relieve your symptoms.  
> If you smoke, it is critical that you stop smoking.  You should also avoid secondhand smoke and contact with people who smoke as much as possible.  Other people who live with you should not smoke in your home.
> Make lifestyle changes that include allergy proofing your home (i.e., vacuuming regularly and covering your mattresses), avoiding cold air or extreme changes in air temperature, eliminating fireplace smoke and other irritating fumes or chemicals, exercising as tolerated and recommended by your healthcare provider, and eating a healthy diet.
If your symptoms interfere with your daily activities, your healthcare provider may prescribe one of several oral medications (those you swallow), an inhaler, and/or a nebulizer to help control and decrease your asthma symptoms. 
> The main goal of the medications is to decrease the inflammation in your lungs and open up the airways so that symptoms are relieved and attacks are prevented.
> Depending on the frequency and severity of your asthma attacks, your health care provider may prescribe medications that you take every day, to prevent asthma attacks.  There are different medications to use when you have an asthma attack, to relieve your symptoms.
> It is very important that you take your medications exactly as your health care provider prescribes. Do not take them more frequently than prescribed!  If they are not working, you should see your health care provider.
> Antibiotics may be needed if you also have a bacterial respiratory infection.
Some people have a specific type of asthma, known as exercise-induced asthma.  For people with this type of asthma, exercise can trigger an asthma attack.  These individuals can often benefit from using an inhaler before any physical activity or exercise.","Asthma is a life-long condition that currently does not have a cure.  However, the symptoms can almost always be managed with life style changes and proper treatment.  Some of the complications of uncontrolled asthma can include:
> inability to exercise or enjoy certain activities 
> difficulty sleeping
> permanent lung damage
> chronic cough
> inability to breathe effectively, leading to the need for a breathing machine
> risk for death in severe cases
","Make an appointment with your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of asthma.

M,AC001,Acne,Cystic Acne | Pimples,http://bit.ly/ScHUJO,"Acne is the development of whiteheads, blackheads, or raised red spots on the skin.  These occur when the pores, or holes in the skin, become blocked with a plug made up of excessive oil, dirt, and bacteria.  If the top of the plug is white, it’s called a whitehead; if it is black, it’s called a blackhead.  Sometimes the plug opens, which allows the oil and bacteria to spread.  This can lead to additional redness and swelling.  If the plug goes deep into the skin, then painful, inflamed pockets (cysts) can form.
> Although it is more common in teenagers, acne can occur in infants and middle-aged adults.
","Acne can be caused or triggered by many things; some of the more common causes and triggers are:
> changes in hormone levels due to menstrual periods, pregnancy, stress, and certain stages of life (e.g. the teenage years)
> cosmetic or hair products that have a lot of oil in them
> certain medications, such as birth control pills, phenytoin (a medication to control seizures that is also known as Dilantin), and steroids 
> a family history of acne  
Some of the more common signs and symptoms of acne include:
> blackheads and/or whiteheads
> painful cysts, pockets, or pustules
> redness and swelling around the base of the pimples
> permanent scarring of the skin.
Before you see a healthcare provider for your acne, there are some things you can try at home.  These include washing your skin with a mild soap that doesn’t dry the skin, especially after exercise or excessive sweating; keeping your hair clean and away from your face; and using over-the-counter acne medications that can kill bacteria and remove excess oil.  
> Do not use oily cosmetics or wash the area excessively.
> Do not squeeze the pimples, which can lead to scarring and infections by releasing the bacteria onto the surrounding skin.  Avoid touching your face with your hands.
> Do not sleep with your makeup on.
If your acne persists, you may need to see a healthcare provider for a treatment plan that often includes both over-the-counter and prescription medications.  The latter may include antibiotics or special solutions that contain antibiotics or retinoic acid.  
","Although flare-ups are possible, acne usually responds well to treatment and often decreases after the teenage years, so the outlook is good in most cases.  However,  possible complications, include:
> permanent changes to the skin, including color changes and scarring
> side effects to the medications used to treat acne
> low self-esteem, decreased confidence, personality changes, and social problems
You should see a healthcare provider if your acne doesn’t get better with home treatment, if it is severe or keeps getting worse, or if you develop scars when the pimples go away.  While acne is a dermatologic (skin) problem, most people with acne can be successfully treated by their primary care physician. Only people with unusually severe acne, which requires certain medications and treatment, generally require a referral to a dermatologist.  
","While acne can go away with self-care, there may be times you need to see a healthcare provider for further treatment.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you’ve had them. 
> Before your appointment, make a list the key parts of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter and supplements); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.

Their color can vary from pink to varying shades of brown.  They are a common type of birthmark and frequently do not require any specific medical treatment.  However, some moles may be a form of  skin cancer. Even non-cancerous moles can sometimes cause problems, like bleeding or irritation if they are located on skin surfaces that rub against clothing.  
> Skin cancer refers to the growth of abnormal (malignant or cancerous) skin cells that can invade local tissues and sometimes spread to other parts of the body.  
> Moles may need to be removed if they  are changing in size or color, they bleed or become irritated or infected,  or there is an increased risk that they are cancerous.  

A skin biopsy to check for abnormal, or cancerous, cells is often done at the same time a mole is removed.  The biopsy can be done using various methods, depending on the type and size of the mole and area of the body involved.  The removal and biopsy of small moles can often be performed in a healthcare provider’s office, but in some cases they may need to be performed in an operating room.  
> Shave biopsy – The surgeon shaves off the top layer of skin.  No stitches are needed after this type of biopsy.
> Punch biopsy – The surgeon uses a sharp, hollow tube to remove a piece of a lesion.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the biopsy.  Depending on how much tissue is removed, sutures may or may not be needed.
> Excisional biopsy – The surgeon removes the entire lesion for testing.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the biopsy.  Sutures are usually needed; a skin graft may also be needed if the lesion is large.  
> Incisional biopsy – The surgeon removes a section of a lesion for testing.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the biopsy.  Depending on how much tissue is removed, sutures may or may not be needed.

For certain type of skin cancers, a type of excision called Mohs surgery is an option. This office-based procedure is done by a certain type of dermatologist who removes thin layers of the cancer and immediately examines them under a microscope.  This is repeated after each removal until the margins of the tissue removed are free of cancer. Mohs surgery, when appropriate, allows for complete removal of the skin cancer, particularly on the face, with an excellent result. ","Two types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, are very slow growing, and their cure rate is very high. However, a third type of skin cancer, melanoma, is very aggressive.  When it is found at a stage where it can be entirely removed by surgery, the outlook is excellent.  However, if it is not found until it has already spread, melanoma is very difficult to treat. Therefore, this is the type of skin cancer that requires the most surveillance.  
> Examine your skin on a monthly basis, using a mirror to check hard-to-see areas.
> Limit your exposure to the sun. 
> When you are out in the sun, cover as much of your skin as possible by wearing shirts with long sleeves, hats, and long pants.  
> Decrease your exposure to the sun during the middle of the day, as that is when the sun exposure is most direct on your skin.  
> Wear sun sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15; make sure you put sunscreen on a half hour before you go into the sun and reapply it frequently.  Remember that snow is a great reflector of sunlight and increases your exposure.  So don’t forget to use sunscreen in the winter months!
>Do not use tanning booths!  Actively discourage your children’s use of tanning booths!  
> Contact your healthcare provider if you have any changes in an existing skin lesion.  If your healthcare provider recommends the removal of a mole and a skin biopsy, prior to the procedure you should tell him or her about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  You should also ask if there are any specific instructions you should follow before and after the procedure.  These may include:
> medications you should not take before the procedure, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure","In most cases, the removal of a mole and skin biopsy are very safe.  There are rarely serious complications, but you should be aware of the risks and talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have.  Some of the potential risks are:
> infection
> bleeding
> scarring
You should let your healthcare provider know if you have any signs of infection (fever, excessive pain, or green discharge) or significant bleeding after the procedure.  If your biopsy is positive for skin cancer, the treatment is based on where it is located and the type of cancer.  The prognosis depends on the specifics of the cancer and how quickly it was treated.  In most cases the main treatment is surgical removal of the lesion.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a mole removal and skin biopsy?
> What is my diagnosis and reason for the procedure?  
> What treatment options are best for me? 
> Do I need to see a dermatologist? Should I see dermatologist who performs Mohs surgery
> Should I see a plastic surgeon?
> Do I need to fast before the procedure and, if so, for how long?  Is there any other special preparation for the procedure?  (If so, get clear instructions on what you need to do.)
> What are the possible complications, how will I feel after the procedure, and how will I have to modify my activity?  Can I shower or bathe as I normally do?

Make a list of your questions/concerns/symptoms and medications (including over-the-counter). Verify which medications you should take before the procedure.  
After your procedure, you should know what you had done, what medication was given (if any), and what symptoms you should report to your healthcare provider. You should also understand all home care instructions (including medications and side effects) and follow-up plans.

The tiny needles stimulate the acupuncture points, which, according to traditional Chinese medicine, will correct imbalances and disruptions in energy flow patterns through the body.  
> Acupuncture is used to treat illness, ease pain, and improve other symptoms.  It is based on the theory that balanced energy flow patterns through the body are essential for health and well-being. 
> It is also thought that acupuncture stimulates the release of natural chemicals that block pain messages that are sent to the brain.  However, much is still unknown about the way acupuncture works.
","Some benefit plans may provide coverage for acupuncture. Please review your coverage documents and/or call the number on the back of your ID card for more information. The estimates shown apply when the service is determined to be a covered service, eligible for in-network reimbursement.

During your treatment, the acupuncturist will insert a series of fine stainless steel needles into your skin.  The needles are inserted along a series of lines or channels called “meridians.” Meridians are thought to be connected to specific organ systems. 
> The needles are left in place for 20 to 30 minutes. 
> You may be sore, numb, or feel a “pins and needles” sensation. 
> To get the desired response, the practitioner may twirl the needles or apply a small amount of electric current to the needles after they are placed in your skin.

No special preparation is needed before you get acupuncture.  Discuss your treatment goals and timeframe with your acupuncturist before starting treatment.  There is no special care after the treatment, but watch the puncture sites for any symptoms of infection including redness, swelling, pain, or fever.  Report any new symptoms or lack of improvement to your healthcare provider. 
> Not everyone responds to acupuncture therapy.  If you are not satisfied with your response after the expected treatment time, you may need to think about other treatment options. ","When compared with medications and other traditional therapies, acupuncture has a smaller risk of complications or side effects. 
> Although acupuncture has been studied for a number of conditions, experts do not all agree on its effectiveness.  The best evidence has been for dental pain and nausea due to several causes.  While it might be effective for a number of other conditions, the evidence to support its use for them is weaker.
> For most health professionals, the biggest concern is that people may delay seeking traditional therapies by only relying on acupuncture treatments.
> Possible complications of acupuncture may include infection and injury to the tissue, increased pain, nerve injury, and pneumothorax (when the lungs have an air leak that causes them to collapse). 
> Laws regarding acupuncture vary from state to state.  Many states license acupuncturists as primary health care providers. Other states only permit an acupuncturist to treat patients if they have been referred by a medical doctor or the acupuncturist is working under a medical doctor's supervision.

It often affects the skin between the toes, but it can also be found on other parts of the foot and between the fingers.  The fungus that causes athlete’s foot, tinea pedis, is one of the most common “tinea” infections.  It usually occurs in warm, moist places on the body.  The risk of catching athlete’s foot increases if you wear shoes that are closed or lined with plastic, your feet sweat a lot or are wet for long periods, or you have an injury to the skin or nails on your feet.  
> Other fungal infections, such as jock itch or ringworm, can be present the same time as athlete’s foot.","Athlete’s foot is contagious.  You can catch it by direct contact or by touching a contaminated surface, such as a shoe, sock, shower floor, or pool.  Preventive measures include keeping your feet dry, wearing sandals in public pools or showers, and wearing shoes that are well ventilated (especially if you are prone to the infection).  The main symptoms of athlete’s foot include:
> skin on your feet that is cracked and peels or flakes off
> skin on your feet that is red, itchy, and burns or stings
> blisters on your feet that are moist and then crust over
If your toenails are affected, they can become thick and discolored. 
Before you see a healthcare provider for your athlete’s foot, there are some things you can try at home.  These include:  
> always keeping your feet dry and clean
> wearing socks that are made of cotton
> making sure your socks are always clean and dry
> using over-the-counter antifungal creams or powders
Athlete’s foot can come  back, so you should continue your treatment for at least a week after your symptoms end.  If your athlete’s foot persists for more than 2 to 4 weeks, or keeps coming back, then you may need to see a healthcare provider for evaluation and further treatment.","Although reoccurrences are possible, athlete’s foot usually responds well to treatment.  You may need to continue preventive measures if you have frequent reoccurrences.  
> Athlete's foot can lead to a bacterial infection of the skin.  Sometimes these infections can be serious.  Proper and prompt treatment of athlete’s foot is particularly important for people with diabetes or circulation problems involving their feet.

It is composed of many parts including bones, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage.  Ankle pain can develop after an injury to any of the structures in the ankle joint, overuse of the ankle joint, arthritis in the ankle joint, or infection in the ankle joint.
> The structure and functions of the ankle make it prone to injury or pain.
> A common ankle injury is an ankle sprain, which is an injury to the ligaments in the ankle.  This typically happens when the ankle is twisted, causing “stretching” or tears of the ligaments.  Ligament injuries can result in bruising, swelling, and difficulty bearing weight on the ankle.
","If you injure or have pain in your ankle, it is important you treat it with some basic first aid.  This can help improve your symptoms and protect your ankle from additional damage.  The common treatment for an ankle injury is known as ""PRICE,"" which stands for Protect, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation.
> Protect your ankle from further injury by supporting it with an ankle brace.  You can also use crutches or a cane to decrease the weight placed on the ankle while it is healing. 
> Rest your ankle.  Minor ankle pain should only require a day or two of rest.  
> Ice your ankle three or four times a day.  Do not use ice longer than 15 minutes at a time and do not apply ice directly to your skin.  People with diabetes or problems with their nerves or circulation should not use ice.
> Compression using a stretchable bandage can help decrease swelling.  When you wrap the bandage around your ankle, make sure it is not too tight and does not decrease the circulation.  You also need to remove the bandage when you sleep.
> Elevate your ankle above your heart.  This will help decrease the swelling in your ankle joint.
Your healthcare provider may recommend over-the-counter medications to help with your pain.  These may include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, or other medications that do not have anti-inflammatory effects, such as acetaminophen.  These medications can interact with other medications, so you should ask your healthcare provider which one is right for you.
","Most episodes of minor ankle pain will resolve uneventfully.  You should contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms.
> You can't put any weight on your ankle.
> You have a lot of pain in your ankle when you are not putting any weight on it.
> There is a lot of swelling in or around your ankle joint.
> You hear a popping noise and have trouble moving the ankle.
> Your ankle is deformed and you think one of the bones in it might be broken.  
> Your ankle pain is severe or persists in spite of home treatment.
>  You feel a pop or snap, followed by an immediate sharp pain in the back of your ankle and/or lower leg, and are not able to walk normally.
If you have a history of problems with your ankles, there are some things you can do to decrease your chance of future episodes of ankle pain or ankle injuries.
> If you are overweight, try to shed some of your extra pounds.  The more you weigh, the greater the strain on your ankles.  
> Do warm up exercises as part of your exercise program, which should be adjusted based on your level of conditioning.
> Wear shoes that give you adequate support and decrease your chance of twisting your ankle; avoid high-heels.  
> If you have a history of ankle problems, take extra precautions by supporting your ankle with a brace, ACE wrap, or other similar product.

The rash may be on one small section of the body or over the entire body. The term “hives” may be used to describe an allergic rash. It can be very difficult, even for a trained healthcare provider, to decide whether a rash is due to an allergy, infection, or other cause.   Some common sources of allergic rashes include:

> medications (penicillin, sulfa)
> insect bites and stings (bees, mosquitoes)
> foods (eggs, peanuts)
> animals (cats, dogs)
> metals (nickel)
> cosmetics and cleaning agents (soap, laundry detergent)
> latex (medical gloves, adhesive bandages)","An allergic rash may not happen the first time a person is exposed to a substance. It can take several exposures before the body responds with a rash.  Most cases of allergic rashes begin to appear 24 to 48 hours after contact with a substance.

> In a few cases, such as eczema, a cream may be prescribed to help decrease itching.  
> Sometimes, a prescription may be ordered to help with the allergy.  
> On some occasions, the rash may spontaneously disappear without intervention.
Allergic rashes usually disappear within 2 to 3 weeks if the causative agent is no longer present, but may occur again if the cause of the reaction isn’t identified.","Healthcare providers often diagnose an allergic rash by looking at the skin and taking a history of prior or current contact to items that may have caused the rash.

The parasites then invade snails, where they mature and are released into the water.  Humans become infected when they swim in the contaminated water. 
> Symptoms are usually mild after the first exposure to the parasite.  Subsequent exposures can result in more severe symptoms. 
","Swimmer’s itch is a rash that develops when someone swims in water that is contaminated with one of the schistosoma parasite.  When you swim in the affected water, the parasites can attach themselves to your uncovered skin.  They then burrow under your skin and die, which causes irritation and inflammation.  
> The parasites may be more prevalent in shallow water, where snails are more abundant. The symptoms of swimmer’s itch include small, reddish bumps that itch.  Usually the itching stops and the affected areas begin to heal on their own within a week.  To control the itching, your healthcare provider may suggest: 
> over-the-counter antihistamines 
> cool compresses 
> oatmeal or baking soda baths

The most common complication of this condition is a secondary bacterial infection, especially if the infection and scratching are severe.  To decrease the chances that you or your child will get swimmer’s itch, take these steps.
> Do not swim in water that is known to be contaminated. 
> Avoid marshy areas where snails are commonly found. 
> If you must be in the water, protect yourself with a full-body swimming suit or wet suit.  > If only your lower legs will be exposed, you can just wear rubber wading boots.

> increased redness, swelling, or tenderness 
> discharge or pus 
> warmth and redness in the surrounding skin

What causes eczema is not clear, but it is a skin reaction that is often noted in people who have allergies, such as hay fever or asthma.  
> Eczema can develop anywhere on the body.  In infants, it is often seen on the cheeks, scalp, arms, or legs.  In older people, it is often seen on the back of elbows or knees, ankles, wrists, face, and upper body (torso). 
> The symptoms of eczema can vary from mild (a few small spots) to severe (patches that cover large areas of skin) and go away completely for long periods of time.  
","Eczema is not contagious.  It typically begins in childhood and is often outgrown by the time a child reaches adulthood.  However, for adults who develop eczema, it is often a lifelong (chronic) condition.  You have an increased risk of developing eczema if other members of your family have a history of eczema or allergies.  
The symptoms of eczema can come and go and can range from mild to severe.  Often the attacks are caused by a “trigger,” which can also make the eczema more difficult to treat.  Some common triggers include:
> certain foods (diet)
> excessive sweating
> skin that is dry or being in air that is dry
> stress
> extreme temperature variations (extreme heat or cold)
> irritating substances or chemicals (soaps, detergents, perfumes, and cosmetics)
> allergens (pollen, dust mites, mold, or certain animals)
> viral illnesses
There is no cure for eczema, so treatment is focused on controlling the symptoms, decreasing the itching, and preventing infection.  Some of the recommended treatments you can do at home include:  
> Keep the skin moist by applying ointments or lotions several times a day.
> Avoid known triggers.
> Avoid hot, long baths; prolonged and frequent exposure to water increases dryness of skin.
> Use soaps and cleansers that do not contain harsh chemicals or perfumes.
Your healthcare provider may recommend over-the-counter antihistamines, prescription creams and ointments, prescription medications that target the immune system, phototherapy (the use of a special light to the affected areas), and an antibiotic if you have a secondary bacterial infection.

","Eczema is a condition you may have for a long time; the flare-ups or attacks can vary depending on your circumstances.  Complications of eczema include a secondary bacterial infection and side effects associated with the medications used to treat eczema.

Symptoms can include itchy eyes and nose, runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.  More severe symptoms can include swelling of the eyelids or other parts of the body or difficulty breathing.
> In allergic rhinitis, the allergic reaction typically starts when an allergen enters the nose and comes into contact with the moist membranes.  The immune system then goes to work to protect the body from what it sees as a foreign substance.  
> Allergens are separated into outdoor allergens (e.g., ragweed, grass, pollen, and mold spores) or indoor allergens (e.g. house dust and mites, indoor mold, cockroaches, and animal dander).  Outdoor allergies, also known as “hay fever,” are typically seasonal.  Indoor allergies may be year-round.  It is important to remember that “hay fever” is not actually associated with a fever.
> Some other reasons for a stuffy nose include aging, irritation from cigarette smoke or other irritants, nasal polyps, deviated septum, alcohol, cold weather, strong odors, and certain medications.  In these cases, the symptoms are caused by irritation and not an allergy.","Allergies often run in families. If your parents have allergies, you are more likely to develop them.  It is not known why some people develop allergies and some don’t.  The first time you are exposed to an allergen, you will not have allergy symptoms.  However, your body will “recognize” this substance as an allergen and you will be more sensitive to it  the next time you are exposed.  If you have allergies and are exposed to an allergen, your first symptoms usually include:
> itching of the eyes and nose
> sneezing
> runny nose
> watery eyes  
After awhile the initial symptoms can progress and lead to:
> nasal congestion
> post-nasal drip
> plugged ears
> other physical or behavioral symptoms  
Allergy symptoms may become worse with each successive exposure.  Before you see a healthcare provider for your allergies, there are some things you can try at home.  These include:
> keeping a diary to try to identify what is causing your symptoms
> reducing your exposure to the allergen or other irritants
> trying over-the-counter medications, such as antihistamines, decongestants, eye drops, and nasal sprays (always follow the package directions as some nasal sprays can only be used for a few days due to side effects that occur after longer use)
You should ask your healthcare provider before taking over-the-counter antihistamines or decongestants, especially if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, or an enlarged prostate.
If your symptoms persist, you may need to see a healthcare provider to find out what is causing your symptoms, get prescription medications, and possibly have allergy testing.  In order to identify what you are allergic to, your healthcare provider will review the history of your symptoms and perform a physical examination.  Allergy testing can then be done to confirm what substances you are allergic too.  
> If the allergen cannot be removed from your environment, or medications do not relieve your symptoms, “allergy shots” (immunotherapy) may be an option.","If you have allergies when you are young, your symptoms may lessen as you grow older.  However, if you develop allergies as an adult, they may persist.  People with allergies may also develop:
> sinus infections
> snoring
> polyps in the nose 
> ear infections  
You should see a healthcare provider if your allergy symptoms don’t get better with home treatment, continue to worsen, or are severe and associated with other symptoms.  Your primary care physician may refer you to a fellowship-trained allergist/immunologist if your symptoms are severe or it is difficult to identify the allergens.","While allergy symptoms can improve with self-care, there may be times you need to see a healthcare provider for further treatment.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you’ve had them. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects or precautions).
> If your healthcare provider wants you to take a medication, ask if an over-the-counter product is right for you.

These may include insect bites, mold, pollen, latex, or animal dander.  This testing can also be done to find the possible cause of certain conditions (asthma, hay fever, and skin irritation).  Two methods of allergy testing are skin tests and blood tests.  
> Skin tests involve placing a small amount of a certain substance into the skin to see if redness and swelling develop.  This can be done by putting the substance on the skin and making a very small scratch with a lancet (prick test).  It can also be done by injecting the substance under the skin with a small needle (intradermal test).  Reactions are usually seen within 15 to 20 minutes. Skin testing is the primary form of allergy testing that is currently used.    
> If skin tests cannot be done, blood tests can help determine the cause of some allergies.  For example, your blood can be combined with particles of a potential allergen to see if there is a response (RAST test).  Blood tests aren’t done routinely because they are more costly than skin testing and may not be as accurate.","Most people with allergies do not need allergy tests.  In most cases, your healthcare provider can determine the cause of your symptoms by taking a careful history and performing a physical examination.  If your symptoms cannot be controlled by avoidance of the offending substance or with medications, your doctor may refer you to an allergist-immunologist for allergy testing.  He or she will review your medical history and do a physical examination.  They may recommend keeping a daily diary of your symptoms.  Prior to having allergy testing, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Also ask about medications you should not take before skin testing.
> Antihistamines can prevent your body from reacting to the substances and result in a false negative result.  
> Some antidepressants, heartburn medications, and asthma medications can also interfere with allergy testing.  
Skin testing can't be done under some circumstances, such as when you're taking a medication that may interfere with the results or if you have certain skin conditions, such as eczema.  In those cases, blood tests may be done instead. ","In most cases, allergy testing does not cause any significant problems.  Skin testing can result in some minor discomfort and itching if there is a positive reaction to the substance.  
> Risks associated with skin testing include a severe allergic reaction, but that is rare.

The shots are also called immunotherapy.  Allergy shots given at specific intervals can improve or relieve allergy symptoms if avoidance and use of  medication are not possible or don't adequately control symptoms.  
> Most people are able to control their allergy symptoms without the use of shots.
> Immunotherapy involves injecting small amounts of a known allergen under the skin, usually in the upper arm.  To help you build immunity, the amount of allergen increases with each shot if no reaction occurred after the previous injection.
> Immunotherapy is  helpful for some people who have allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic asthma, and hypersensitivity to stinging insects.
","Most persons with allergy symptoms can receive the care they need from their primary healthcare provider.  Occasionally, if your symptoms are difficult to control or the cause of the symptoms is difficulty to identify, your primary healthcare provider may refer you to an allergist-immunologist.  An allergist-immunologist will take a comprehensive history, examine you, and possibly perform allergy tests.  If your allergy tests are positive, and your symptoms cannot be controlled with avoidance or medications, you may be recommended for allergy shots.   Your healthcare provider may recommend keeping a daily diary of your symptoms once your allergy shots have begun.  
> Immunotherapy isn't a cure for allergies and improvement isn't guaranteed. However, it may decrease your sensitivity to a specific allergen.
> Sublingual allergy treatment has recently been approved, but allergy shots remain the recommend method for providing immunotherapy.   
> Allergy shots require frequent visits to your healthcare provider for an extended period of time.  Consider this time commitment before starting immunotherapy. 
> Although research continues, immunotherapy is not recommended for people who are sensitive to certain foods.","A full course of immunotherapy often requires regular injections over several years.  It can provide improvement in allergy symptoms for years after the therapy has ended.
> Immunotherapy does not work for everyone. It also requires frequent visits to your healthcare provider.
> In most cases, allergy shots do not cause any significant problems.  Reactions at the injection site, or throughout the body, are possible.

The types of breaks are:
> Open (also known as compound) fracture – the broken bone comes through the skin or a skin wound extends down to the broken bone
> Closed fracture – the skin over the broken bone remains intact
> Displaced fracture – the bone becomes misaligned or displaced at the site of the break
> Comminuted fracture – the bone is broken into several pieces
> Greenstick fracture – the bone bends and cracks but does not break completely
> Buckle or torus fracture – one side of the bone bends or buckles on itself
Greenstick and buckle fractures are more common in children because their bones are softer and more pliable than the bones of an adult.

The upper extremity (arm) is made up of three bones.

> The humerus is the bone on the top part of your arm.  It is the largest bone in the arm.  
> The wrist is made up of 8 small bones (carpal bones) and the radius and the ulna. 
Some common ways that people break one of the bones in their wrist include falling (especially falling onto an outstretched hand), playing sports, major trauma (such as during a car or bike accident), and abuse, especially child abuse.  There are medical conditions, such as osteoporosis, that can increase your risk of a broken bone.","A break in one of the bones in your wrist often results in a snap or cracking sound followed by pain that increases with movement, difficulty moving your wrist, swelling, and bruising.  In severe cases, the wrist is in an abnormal position (displaced fracture) or the bone breaks through the skin (open fracture).  A broken bone requires prompt evaluation and treatment by a healthcare provider to make sure the bone heals properly and is well aligned.  Therefore, contact your healthcare provider if you think you may have broken your wrist.  He or she will take a medical history, do a physical exam that focuses on the affected wrist, and order x-rays of your wrist to assess the bones.  In some cases a CT scan may be needed.  

Treatment for a broken wrist will depend on the type and location of the break.  Depending on the severity of the break, you may be referred to an orthopedic surgeon for evaluation and treatment.
> In some cases, a simple break can be treated with immobilization and ice to help decrease swelling.  You may need to wear a sling, splint, or other device to restrict the movement of the broken bone and allow healing.  You may need to restrict movement for several  weeks.  
> You will likely be given some medications to decrease pain and swelling.  This is usually an over-the-counter pain reliever. If you have significant pain you may need a stronger prescription pain reliever for a day or two.
> If a fracture is displaced, your healthcare provider may need to put the bones back into proper alignment (reduction of fracture).  This can be painful and may require medication or anesthesia before the reduction is performed.
> A break that is severe, open, displaced, or results in a bone being “shattered” may need surgery.  This can help put the bones in proper alignment and promote healing.  Surgery usually involves using wires, plates, nails, or screws to hold the bone in the correct position while it heals.

The types of breaks are:
> Open (also known as compound) fracture - the broken bone comes through the skin or a skin wound extends down to the broken bone
> Closed fracture - the skin over the broken bone remains intact
> Displaced fracture - the bone becomes misaligned or displaced at the site of the break
> Comminuted fracture - the bone is broken into several pieces
> Greenstick fracture – the bone bends and cracks but does not break completely
> Buckle or torus fracture - one side of the bone bends or buckles on itself
Greenstick and buckle fractures are more common in children because their bones are softer and more pliable than the bones of an adult.

Finger fractures can happen when you slam your finger in a door, fall onto an outstretched hand, or try to catch a ball. They can also occur if you use power tools without paying close attention.","A break in one of the finger bones typically results in pain that increases with movement, difficulty moving your finger, swelling, and bruising.  In severe cases, the finger may be in an abnormal position (displaced fracture) or the bone breaks through the skin (open fracture).  A broken bone requires prompt evaluation and treatment by a healthcare provider. This is especially important if you have numbness or swelling.  Delays in treatment can result in poor healing with decreased range of motion and grip strength.  Therefore, contact your healthcare provider if you think you may have broken a finger.  He or she will take a medical history, do a physical exam that focuses on the affected hand, and order x-rays of your finger to assess the bones.  Rarely, a CT scan may be needed.  

Treatment for a broken finger will depend on the type and location of the break.  Depending on the severity of the break, you may be referred to an orthopedic surgeon for evaluation and treatment.
> In some cases, a simple break can be treated with immobilization and ice to help decrease swelling.  You may need to wear a splint or other device to restrict the movement of the broken bone and allow healing.  You may need to restrict movement for several weeks.  
> You will likely be given some medications to decrease pain and swelling.  This is usually an over-the-counter pain reliever, but if you have significant pain you may need a stronger prescription pain reliever for a day or two.
> If a fracture is displaced, your healthcare provider may need to put the bones back into proper alignment (reduction of fracture).  This can be painful and may require medication or anesthesia before the reduction is performed.
> A break that is severe, open, displaced, or results in a bone being “shattered” may require surgery. This can help put the bones in proper alignment and promote healing.  Surgery usually involves using small wires, plates, nails, or screws to hold the bone in the correct position while it heals.
> Physical or occupational therapy may be recommended in certain circumstances. This may help reduce the chance of having decreased function of the finger after healing of the fracture.

An IUD may prevent pregnancy by impairing the normal function of sperm or by making it more difficult for a fertilized egg to implant itself in the uterus.  In the United States, there are currently two types of IUDs.  
> A copper IUD is a plastic T-shaped device that has copper wire wrapped around the stem and arms.  This type of IUD can be effective for up to 10 years and is appropriate for women who can't use, or prefer not to use, hormonal methods of birth control.  A copper IUD can also be effectively used for emergency contraception if it is inserted within 5 days of unprotected sex.
> A levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is a plastic T-shaped device that releases the hormone levonorgestrel.  Levonorgestrel causes changes to the lining of the uterus and can prevent ovulation.  This provides further protection against pregnancy.  It is also effective in reducing bleeding and cramping during menstrual periods.  This type of IUD can be effective for 3 to 5 years, depending on the amount of hormones in the device.  
> Both the copper and levonorgestrel IUDs are more than 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy.","If pregnancy prevention is desired for a number of years, an IUD may be an appropriate choice of birth control for women of any age.  
> An IUD may not be recommended in certain situations, such as an oddly shaped uterus, unexplained vaginal bleeding, and certain types of cancer (uterine, cervical, or breast).  These may also include a bleeding disorder, liver disease, or participation in high risk sexual behavior.  
Before fitting you for an IUD, your healthcare provider will review your medical history and do a pelvic exam. Lab work may be done to make sure you are not pregnant and do not have a sexually transmitted disease (STD). 
> An IUD is inserted through the cervix (the opening of the uterus).  You may notice some cramping when it is put into place. Tell your healthcare provider if you feel faint, dizzy, or experience sharp pain. 
> Your doctor may recommend pain medication if you have cramping after the procedure. 
> It can be done at any time, but some healthcare providers recommend insertion during or just after your menstrual period.  If it is inserted during your period, or right after you have a baby, the risk of the IUD falling out increases slightly.

Before you leave the office, it is important you know how to feel for the strings attached to the IUD. 
> When you can feel the strings, you will know the IUD is in place. You should check the strings at the same time each month, such as right after you have your period.
> If the strings are missing, use a backup method of birth control until you are evaluated by your healthcare provider. 
> Over time, the strings may feel softer and may curl around the cervix.  This can make them a little more difficult to locate. 
It is important to remember that IUDs do not protect against any STDs.  If you are not in a monogamous relationship, you should practice safe sex and use a condom during any sexual contact. ","In addition to being a safe and effective form of birth control, IUDs have other benefits. 
> They are not permanent and pregnancy is possible right after removal.   
> They don't interfere with breastfeeding or affect a nursing baby. 
> You can use tampons and condoms while an IUD is in place. 
> They are convenient, can remain in place for long periods of time, and are cost effective over the long-term. 
> The LNG-IUS often decreases excessive and painful menstruation.  It can be used to treat heavy bleeding during menses. 

Some risks are associated with having an IUD in place.  
> There is a slightly increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). 
> The copper IUD may produce heavier and longer menstrual periods, especially the first few menses after insertion. 
> The LNG-IUS can lead to spotting and absence of menses. Headaches, sore breasts, mood changes, and acne can occur due to the hormone in the LNG-IUS.
> In about 3 to 10 percent of women, the IUD falls out in the first year.  This is more common if you haven't had a baby, are younger than 20, or the IUD was inserted right after you had a baby. 
> Pregnancy is possible if an IUD falls out and it goes undetected.  
> If pregnancy occurs when an IUD is in place, there is a slightly increased risk of miscarriage, pelvic infection, premature birth, and the pregnancy implanting outside the uterus.  
> Rarely, the uterus may be perforated during IUD insertion. 
> Rarely, an IUD can move out of place, perforate the uterus or cervix, or embed itself in the wall of the uterus.  In such cases, surgical removal of the IUD may be needed.
","Make an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your birth control options.  If you decide to have an IUD inserted, ask your healthcare provider the following questions.  
> What are the benefits and risks of the two types of IUDs approved for use in the United States? 
> Is one type of IUD a better option over the other for me? Why or why not? 
> How does the IUD compare with other types of birth control? 
> How long will the procedure take? 
> What symptoms are normal after the procedure? When should I be concerned? 
> How long after insertion should I see you? 
> What should I do if I can't feel the strings or they're shorter or longer than usual?
It is important to consult your doctor when you'd like to have the IUD removed.  Do not attempt to remove an IUD yourself.

The instruments are inserted into 1 or 2 small cuts in the abdomen. 
> The fallopian tubes may be clamped shut with plastic clips or rings or cut and then sewn closed.  Or they may be sealed with electrical cauterization using a heated wire. 
> A tubal ligation prevents pregnancy in two ways.  First, it blocks the path an egg takes from the ovaries to the uterus.  The egg, even if it is fertilized, is unable to implant in the uterine wall.  Second, it blocks the sperm from traveling up the fallopian tubes to the egg. 
> For the first year after the procedure, a tubal ligation is more than 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy.  The effectiveness may change over time and can vary depending on the specific surgical method and age at the time of the procedure.","A tubal ligation is an appropriate decision if permanent pregnancy prevention is desired for personal or medical reasons.  It can be done after childbirth or as a separate outpatient procedure.
> A tubal ligation is considered permanent.  This can have an emotional impact.  Before any type of permanent birth control, carefully consider issues that may be hard to think about (divorce, death of your spouse, death of a child).  It is important you discuss this and other methods of permanent birth control with your spouse or partner. 

Prior to surgery tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking.  This may include over-the-counter medications and supplements.  Lab work may be done to make sure you are not pregnant and do not have a sexually transmitted disease (STD).  Ask about other specific instructions you need to follow before and after the procedure.  These include:
> medications you should not take before the procedure, such as blood thinners or aspirin
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the procedure
> any activity or dietary restrictions you should follow during your recovery

During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. Anesthesia may include one of the following:
> Spinal anesthesia: This is an injection of numbing medication into your back and a relaxing medication in your IV.  You’ll be awake during surgery, but should not feel anything below your waist.
> General anesthesia: This is a type of anesthesia where you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  

You will probably go home the day of your surgery.
> Don’t forget to make arrangements for transportation to and from the facility.  Make plans for help at home while you recover. 
> Strenuous activity, tampon use, douching, and sexual activity are typically restricted for a week or so after the procedure. 
> You may need pain medication and rest while you recover.
> Let your healthcare provider know if you have increasing pain, fever, or bleeding. 
> If you are a smoker, quit smoking as it can interfere with your recovery.
It is important to remember that having a tubal ligation does not protect against any STDs.  If you are not in a monogamous relationship, you should limit your sexual partners and use a condom during any sexual contact.","In addition to being a safe and effective form of birth control, a tubal ligation has other benefits.
> It does not interfere with your hormones, so your sex drive and menstrual period are not affected. 
> Pregnancy prevention occurs immediately, so backup contraception is not necessary.  
> A significantly lower incidence of ovarian cancer, although the reasons are unclear. 

Although the outcome after a tubal ligation is typically very good, there are some risks associated with the surgery.  
> General surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and infection.
> Risks that are specific to a tubal ligation include infection, bleeding, and accidental damage to other structures in the area.
> Rarely, it is possible to become pregnant after a tubal ligation.  The few women who do become pregnant have a higher risk of ectopic pregnancy (the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus).

Reversal of a tubal ligation may be possible in some cases, but it depends on what type of procedure was done.  It also depends on how much of the fallopian tube was left intact.  You should always consider tubal ligation a permanent form of birth control.
> Procedures using electrocoagulation destroy the greatest amount of the fallopian tube. For these reasons, they have the lowest successful reversal rate.
> After the reversal of a tubal ligation, the risk of ectopic pregnancy increases.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a tubal ligation?
> What surgical method will you use? 
> What are the possible risks/complications, how will I feel after the surgery, and will I have to modify my activity? 
> What type of anesthesia will you use? 
> What type of medication can I take to manage the pain after the procedure? 
> When can I return to work and resume sexual activity?

If drawing blood from your vein, the person drawing blood will first put a tight band, called a tourniquet, on your arm to make your veins swell.  After they locate a good vein, they will insert a small needle.  Blood will flow from the needle into a small test tube that is air tight.  
> The usual place to insert the needle is the inside of the elbow.
> In some cases, blood may be obtained by pricking a finger with a sharp instrument.  
","Blood is taken from a vein to test for a variety of medical conditions and drug levels. In an adult, the blood sample is usually taken by placing a needle in a vein of the arm or back of the hand.  If blood is taken from an infant, it is usually collected by pricking a finger or heel.  
> Some tests do not require any special preparation.  However, some tests require you to stop eating for a certain number of hours or avoid certain medications before the test.  There may also be other instructions you need to follow.
> Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take.
> Make sure you follow all the instructions given to you by your healthcare provider. 
","Your healthcare provider may order a blood draw to diagnose a medical condition, help monitor a medical condition, or check the level of certain medications in your blood.                 
> This test may cause slight bruising or bleeding.  Risks are very rare but include infection.
 > After a blood draw you may develop a black and blue mark (hematoma) where the needle was inserted.  This is especially likely if you are taking aspirin or blood thinners (anticoagulants, such as warfarin).  To decrease the chance of developing a hematoma, you should keep pressure where the needle went in for at least five minutes after it is removed.

The symptoms of a urinary tract depend on where the infection is in the urinary tract.  The most common sites of a urinary tract infection are the bladder and kidneys.  
> An infection of the bladder is called cystitis.  The symptoms of cystitis include urine that is cloudy or contains blood, painful urination, discomfort in the lower abdomen or back, and a strong urge to urinate frequently.  Occasionally a low grade fever is present.  
> An infection of the kidney is called pyelonephritis.  The symptoms of pyelonephritis include shaking chills or sweating at night, fatigue, fever, back or groin pain, skin that is warm and flushed, nausea, and vomiting.  Occasionally severe abdominal pain is present.","A urinary tract infection is usually caused by bacteria.  The bacteria usually enter the urinary tract through the urethra and can travel upwards toward the kidneys.  Certain conditions can limit the body’s ability to control the growth of the bacteria. These include:
> diabetes, enlarged prostate, or other urinary tract problems 
> advanced age (especially people in nursing homes)
> not moving for long periods of time
> a history of kidney stones
> not being able to control your bowels
> having a catheter in place to drain urine
> pregnancy
In addition, urinary tract infections are more common in women because they have shorter urethras that are closer to their rectum.  
You should call your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection.  He or she can perform a urine test and order an antibiotic if a urinary tract infection is diagnosed.  Some other medications may help relieve the painful urination that often comes with a urinary tract infection.   
Here are some things you can do at home to decrease your symptoms and prevent future urinary tract infections.  
> Drink plenty of fluids, but avoid those that can cause bladder irritation (e.g. alcohol and caffeinated beverages).  Cranberry juice is frequently recommended, but its effectiveness is up for debate.
> Make sure to keep your genital area clean.  Women should always wipe from front to back after using the bathroom.
> Avoid wearing pants that are tight.  
People who have frequent urinary tract infections, or infections that don’t go away with medications, may be referred to an urologist for further evaluation and treatment.","Most people without risk factors will recover from a urinary tract infection without complications.  For those people, symptoms are usually improved within 1 to 2 days after a bladder infection and 7 days after a kidney infection.   There are potential serious complications to a urinary tract infection.  These include:
> severe kidney infection that requires hospitalization for fluids and antibiotics 
> scarring or damage to the kidney
> infection in the blood stream (sepsis)","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a urinary tract infection.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you’ve had them. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects or precautions).

> narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis)
> a tumor or infection that affects your spinal cord
> a herniated or bulging disc
> swelling or irritation of the spinal cord membrane
> blood vessel abnormalities in the spine
You may also need a myelogram if a previous MRI or CT scan did not determine the cause of your symptoms.

Prior to the procedure, tell your doctor about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about other specific instructions to follow before and after the procedure.  These include:
> medications you should not take before the procedure, such as blood thinners or aspirin
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure

> Don’t forget to make arrangements for transportation to and from the facility and for help at home. Even if you are awake, you will not be allowed to drive home after your myelogram.

This care path's costs include the facility charges (the test or procedure) plus the physician charges (interpreting the test or performing the procedure). You may get separate bills for the facility and physician charges.
","A myelogram with CT scan can help a healthcare provider evaluate conditions such as back pain, back injuries, cancers, infections, and problems with the blood vessels to the back. 
> Risks associated with a myelogram include a leak of cerebrospinal fluid, headaches, nausea and vomiting, infection, temporary leg or lower back numbness, and bleeding into the spinal canal.  There is also a small risk of seizures after the dye is injected.

The plaque narrows the artery and decreases the blood flow through it.  A carotid endarterectomy involves the surgical removal of atherosclerotic plaque from the inner wall of the carotid artery.  The artery is accessed by making an incision on the affected side of the neck.    
> The carotid arteries are the main arteries that carry blood from the base of the neck to the brain.  When plaque builds up on the inner wall of one of the carotid arteries it can decrease, or even stop, the flow of blood to the brain. This can result in a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as “mini-stroke,” or stroke. 
","Some of the risk factors for developing a blockage of your carotid artery include: 
> high blood pressure 
> other cardiovascular disease 
> obesity 
> diabetes 
> use of tobacco products 
> elevated cholesterol 
If your lifestyle increases your risk of carotid artery disease, your doctor may make recommendations to decrease your risk.  Some of the most frequently recommended lifestyle changes include stopping the use of all tobacco products, avoiding secondhand smoke, consuming a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.

If you have atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries, you may have atherosclerosis in another part of your body.  This includes the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart.  For that reason, you will need a careful evaluation to determine your risk for coronary heart disease and, if necessary, begin interventions that can reduce the risk.  Many factors will be considered before your healthcare provider recommends a carotid endarterectomy.  These include: 
> the extent of narrowing in your arteries (carotid and coronary)  
> your risk factors for a stroke 
> whether you have had symptoms of a TIA, which can signal an impending stroke
> whether you have had a previous stroke  
The symptoms of a stroke and TIA can be similar, but vary in severity and whether or not they are temporary (TIA) or permanent (stroke).  The symptoms can include weakness, tingling, drooping, or numbness on one side of the body; vision loss in one eye; dizziness or lightheadedness; difficulty speaking or loss of speech; loss of balance or coordination; sudden and severe headache; and confusion.  To help people remember the signs and symptoms of a stroke, many organizations use the acronym FAST.
> Face – does one side of the face droop when smiling?
> Arms – does one arm drift downwards when both are held up?
> Speech – does one’s speech seem slurred or different?
> Time – time is critical if someone has these symptoms.
Time is critical when the blood flow to the brain has been decreased.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms of a stroke. 

If your healthcare provider recommends a carotid endarterectomy, prior to surgery tell him or her about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery. These may include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners 
> regular medications you should take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before surgery
Before you have an endarterectomy, various diagnostic studies may be done to clarify your diagnosis and verify the need for surgery.  These tests include ultrasound doppler studies to check the flow of blood through the carotid arteries, MRI scan, CT scan, and arteriography (injection of dye to get images of the inside of the carotid artery).  If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.  

During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia is the most common type of anesthesia for a carotid artery endarterectomy.  With this type of anesthesia, you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
> In some cases, local anesthesia and a relaxing medication is possible for a carotid artery endarterectomy.   
You will likely spend a day or two in the hospital after surgery.  You may need pain medication and help at home while you recover.","The most serious risk associated with carotid artery disease is a stroke, which can lead to permanent disability and death.  A carotid endarterectomy can reduce the risk of TIAs, strokes, and death in people with greater than 70 percent narrowing of the carotid arteries. 
The general surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and various infections.  Risks specific to a carotid endarterectomy can vary depending on the surgeon's or radiologist's expertise and your general health.  Possible risks include: 
> stroke 
> heart attack 
> postprocedure hypertension (high blood pressure) or hypotension (low blood pressure) 
> hematoma (a swelling or mass of blood near the wound) 
> death (very rare) 
A carotid endarterectomy may also cause an injury to a cranial nerve, one of 12 pairs of nerves that originate in the brain.","If you have any symptoms of carotid artery stenosis, make an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your options.  Ask your healthcare provider the following questions.  
> Am I at risk for a TIA or stroke?  How can I decrease my risk?  
> What are my treatment options?
> Can my symptoms be controlled with medications?  If so, are their Tier 1 or Tier 2 medications on my Prescription Drug List that I should take?
> Do I need any special tests?  What are the benefits and risks of having the tests?

Rhinoviruses are the most common cause of the common cold.  The condition is NOT caused by going outside with wet hair or not wearing warm enough clothes.
> Cigarette smoke and other airway irritants can increase your risk for getting a cold.  This is because they damage the small hairs (cilia) that line the airways and help remove irritating particles, viruses, or bacteria.   
> The common cold occurs more often in the winter, but it is not because of the cold weather itself.  The increased risk is due to the dry air, which dries out the nasal passages, and the fact that we spend more time indoors, which increases the risk of exposure to higher concentrations of the virus. 
> Some of the other conditions with similar symptoms include allergies, bronchitis, strep throat, and influenza (flu).  Usually, people with the flu feel much sicker than people with a cold.","The viruses that cause the common cold can spread by coughing, sneezing, or touching an infected surface or object.  Others can “catch” the virus if they breathe in the infected droplets or touch an infected surface, and then touch their nose or mouth. The first symptoms of the common cold usually begin rapidly, typically 1 to 3 days after exposure.  They include: 
> irritated throat
> runny nose (nasal discharge)
> sneezing
At times a mild sore throat, mild headache, mild muscles aches, slight fever, and coughing can develop.  The nasal discharge usually starts clear but can develop a yellow greenish discoloration.  Although the sore throat is usually brief, the nasal discharge and cough can continue for a couple of weeks.  
If you have a cold, you should make sure you get plenty of rest and drink an adequate amount of fluids. You can also try running a cool mist humidifier to help keep mucus membranes moist and relieve a dry cough, but make sure you follow the manufacturers directions for periodically cleaning the humidifier.  You should also avoid cigarette smoke and other respiratory irritants.  If your symptoms persist, your healthcare provider may recommend an over-the-counter or prescription medication.  
> You should consult your healthcare provider before taking over-the-counter antihistamines or decongestants, especially if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, or an enlarged prostate.
> Most coughs should go away in a couple of weeks.  If your symptoms continue or get worse, you may have developed a bacterial infection on top of the virus (secondary infection).  
> Antibiotics are not effective against viruses. The overuse of antibiotics can result in bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics and expose people to the risk of antibiotic side effects.
In order to decrease the spread of any virus, you should avoid others who have cold or flu symptoms, stay home if you have cold or flu symptoms, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, avoid touching your face, and wash your hands frequently!
Here are some important things to remember when treating a child’s cold symptoms.
> Children and adolescents (age 18 years and under) should not receive aspirin products to treat cold symptoms.
> You should not give decongestants to a child under the age of 4.
> Over-the-counter cough and cold products have not been shown to be effective in young children.
> You should not give cough and cold products to a child unless directed by the child’s healthcare provider.
> Always read and follow the instructions on the product label.","Most people recover from the common cold without complications.  However, this viral infection can occasionally aggravate asthma and lead to other bacterial infections in the lungs, ears, and sinuses.  People who are at high risk for complications include the very young, the very old, and those with pre-existing medical conditions, such as a weak immune system and asthma. 
To decrease the likelihood of catching cold or developing complications, you can take these steps.  
> If you smoke, stop!  Also, avoid secondhand smoke.  
> Wear a mask or respirator if you work with chemicals and dust
> Avoid exposure to anyone who has a cold or the flu.
People at high risk should get a flu and pneumonia vaccine every year.","Make an appointment with your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a cold that are getting worse or not improving within 7 to 10 days.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects). 
> If your healthcare provider wants you to take a medication, ask if an over-the-counter product is right for you.

The bone graft can come from a bone in your body (autograft), a bone from someone else’s body (allograft), or it can be a man-made substance.  Screws, rods, and plates are also used to keep the bones in place while the bone grafts heal.","Your healthcare provider may recommend a cervical spine fusion if you are having surgery to remove all or part of the cushion that separates the bones in the neck (diskectomy).  Some other reasons for a cervical fusion include:
> spine injury or fracture
> spine that is unstable or weak
> vertebrae that move and slip over one another (spondylolisthesis)
> abnormal curves in the cervical spine (kyphosis)
Prior to surgery, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery. These may include:
> meeting with a physical therapist to learn how to use a back brace and walk with crutches.
> medications you should not take before surgery; including medications that make your blood harder to clot (warfarin or Coumadin, aspirin, or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen)
> regular medications you should take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.  
During the surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia, the most common type of anesthesia for a cervical fusion, is where you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
A cervical fusion typically takes 3 to 4 hours. You will spend a few days in the hospital after surgery. 
> While you are in the hospital, the people caring for you will teach you the right way to move, sit, stand, and walk after a cervical fusion.  
> You may have to wear a neck brace for a period of time.
> Physical therapy is often recommended for several weeks after back surgery.  This is to help increase your strength and mobility.
> You may also need pain medication and help at home while you recover.
> It may take from a few weeks to a few months before you are back to your normal activity level.","Cervical fusion will probably not take away all your symptoms. You may still have problems with your upper back (neck).  The outcome after surgery will depend on many factors, so there is no way to know exactly what your outcome will be.  You may have to change your level and type of activity after a cervical fusion.  Losing excess weight and exercising can improve your outcome.  
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, various infections, and heart attack or stroke.  Risks specific to this type of surgery include infection in the area of the surgery and injury to structures, nerves, and blood vessels in the back.  It is also possible that the surgery will not relieve your back pain or your back pain will return.    
> The areas of your spine above and below the fusion are likely to cause you problems in the future.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a cervical fusion?
> What is my diagnosis and reason for the surgery?  How might my condition be treated other than with surgery?
> Do I need to fast before the surgery and, if so, for how long?  Is there any other special preparation for the surgery?  (If so, get clear instructions on what you need to do.)  What kind of sedation will I have? What are the possible side effects? Are there any alternative treatments to improve my symptoms?
> Ask about possible complications, how you will feel after the surgery, and how you will have to modify your activity. Don’t forget to make arrangements for transportation to and from the facility and help at home.
Make a list of your questions/concerns/symptoms and medications (including over-the-counter). > Verify which medications you should take before the surgery.  
After your surgery, you should know what you had done, what medication was given, and what symptoms you should report to your healthcare provider. You should also understand all home care instructions (including medications and side effects) and follow-up plans.

A common term used to describe this type of neck pain is a “stiff neck.”  Other more serious causes of neck pain include an injury to the structures in the neck (muscles, nerves, vertebrae, or vertebral discs), certain medical conditions (arthritis, fibromyalgia or cancer), spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal column), and infection.  After performing a history and physical exam, a healthcare provider can recommend specific treatments for your neck pain.  These may include:
> exercises to strengthen the neck and shoulder muscles
> education and training in self-care, correct posture, and body alignment
","Neck pain is usually self-limited and will go away without specific treatment.  In most cases, x-rays are not needed for uncomplicated neck pain, especially if it is not severe or there are no other concerning symptoms or history of a recent injury.  Some things you can do at home to decrease your neck pain include:
> applying heat or cold to the painful areas (whichever works best for you, but try cold for the first 48 to 72 hours)
> taking over-the-counter pain relievers as directed on the packaging or by your healthcare provider
> slowing down for a few days (try to get back to your normal activities as soon possible)
You should see a healthcare provider if your neck pain gets worse, does not start to improve in a few days, or is severe or associated with other symptoms (such as fever, headache, swollen glands, inability to touch your chin to your chest, or weakness, numbness or tingling in your arm or hand).
> If your neck pain began after a fall or other injury you should seek medical attention.
> You should also seek immediate medical attention if you have symptoms of meningitis (fever, headache, or your neck is so stiff that you cannot touch your chin to your chest) or you have symptoms of a heart attack (shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, vomiting, or arm or jaw pain).
> If your neck pain began after a fall or other injury and you are have a sudden onset of paralysis, decreased movement, weakness, numbness or tingling in your arm or hand, chest discomfort, or trouble breathing – call 911! 
","Your healthcare provider will review your medical history, check your symptoms, and see if they can determine the cause of your neck pain.

> Talk about your preferences and concerns, including costs of services, with your health care provider.
> It is important to remember that the total cost of this care path does not include medication, imaging studies, or referrals to other healthcare providers; those charges can add up.
","If you contact your healthcare provider for evaluation of your neck pain, be prepared to discuss your symptoms, how long you’ve had them, and if you have had them before. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your questions, concerns, and symptoms; your medications (including over-the-counter); and what makes your pain better or worse.
> During your appointment, ask what might be causing the pain; when you should start to see improvement; if you should exercise or modify your activity; what the follow-up plans are; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan. You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications you should take (including possible side effects).

Symptoms usually develop about 10 to 21 days after exposure.  The infected person can spread the virus a day or two before they develop symptoms until the blisters, or pox, are all dry and crusted over.  
> There is a vaccine to help prevent a child from getting the chickenpox.  The vaccine is very effective and is now recommended as part of routine childhood immunizations.  Due to the use of the vaccine, chickenpox is becoming much less common.
> Children who are vaccinated may transmit the infection to others, so they should not be around people who have not had chickenpox or who have certain immune problems.","Chickenpox typically causes vague symptoms a few days before the development of itchy, fluid-filled blisters (pox) that burst and crust over.  The classic rash usually starts on the face, chest, or scalp and then develops in clusters over the rest of the body.  Pox can also be seen in the mouth, vagina, or on the eyelids.  It usually takes about a week for all the blisters to burst and crust over.  Children with any blisters that have not crusted over should not attend school or be in other public settings.  Some of the early symptoms can include:
> fever
> headache
> stomach ache  
> loss of appetite
Once the blisters form, there are some things you can try at home to relieve the intense itching.  These include:
> oatmeal baths in lukewarm water
> over-the-counter medications, such as oral antihistamines and topical lotions
> trimming fingernails to decrease the risk of infection from scratching
It is important that you do NOT give your child aspirin when they have the chickenpox; this can increase their risk of developing Reye’s Syndrome, a potentially life threatening condition that especially affects the liver and brain.  
You should visit your primary healthcare provider only if you are not sure what your child has or if their symptoms are severe. Otherwise, other children in the waiting area will be exposed. 
> If you do visit your healthcare provider, notify the office in advance that you think your child has chickenpox.  That way they can make arrangements to separate your child from other patients.","Most children who develop chickenpox recover without problems.  The pox usually do not result in scars unless they become infected with a bacteria, usually due to scratching.  Typically adults and older children get sicker than younger children.  In addition, people with asthma, a weak immune system due to illness or medications (chemotherapy or steroids), and other skin problems (eczema or recent sunburn) are at increased risk for complications, which can be serious.  
Some rare, but serious, complications of chickenpox include:
> brain inflammation (encephalitis), pneumonia, and other infections 
> Reye’s syndrome (if taking aspirin for relief of symptoms)
Non-aspirin-containing fever and pain reducers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, do not cause Reye syndrome and are safe to administer to children with chickenpox.
Women who get chickenpox while pregnant can have a child with birth defects.  Newborns and children under the age of 1 will typically have immunity from their mother.  However, if she does not have a history of chickenpox, and lacks immunity, they will be at high risk if they are exposed. 
Once you have had chickenpox, the virus stays in your body for the rest of your life and immunity to chickenpox can be long-lasting.  Although your immune system typically prevents the virus from causing problems, in some adults the virus can come back and cause a condition known as shingles (herpes zoster).  This can occur at times when the body’s immune system is impaired.","There are prescription medications that your healthcare provider may recommend, especially if you, or your child, is at high risk for complications.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you’ve had them. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.

Your healthcare provider may recommend a breast biopsy to check for breast cancer if you have changes in your mammogram or breast exam.  Depending on the circumstances, a breast biopsy can be done in a healthcare provider’s office or operating room.  There are various methods that may use ultrasound, mammography, or other imaging techniques to help identify the area to be biopsied.  
> Needle biopsy – The surgeon removes tissue through a small needle (aspiration biopsy) or a hollow needle (punch biopsy).  Occasionally a vacuum-type device is used to pull out the breast tissue.  A needle biopsy is done through a small hole made in the skin, so there is less chance of infection or scarring; however, the results may not be as accurate because it is possible to miss cancerous cells.
> Incisional biopsy – The surgeon makes an incision and removes a piece of breast tissue for testing.  A medication is injected into the area to numb it prior to the biopsy.  Sutures are usually needed to close the incision.   An incisional biopsy is done through a small cut made in the skin, so there is a greater chance of infection or scarring; however, the results are typically more accurate because there is less of a chance the surgeon will miss cancerous cells.
> Lumpectomy – The surgeon makes an incision and removes about ¼ of the breast for testing. Depending on the circumstances, additional tissue around the lump may also be removed.  A medication is injected into the area to numb it prior to the biopsy.  Sutures are usually needed to close the incision.
","There are many risk factors that increase your chance of getting breast cancer.  These risks factors can be divided into those that you cannot control and those that you can control or eliminate.  Here are some of the uncontrollable risks factors for breast cancer.  
> Age – you have a higher risk as you age.
> Sex – although men can get breast cancer, women have a much higher risk.
> Family history – a close family member has had cancer of the breast, uterus, ovary, or colon.
> Genetics – you have a defect in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.  These genes produce a protein that helps protect the body from cancer.  Only about 1percentage of women with strong family histories of breast and ovarian cancer have this gene.
> Menstrual cycle – you started your period before you were 12 or went through menopause after you were 55.  This is thought to be due to the prolonged exposure to estrogen.  

Here are some of the controllable risks factors for breast cancer.  
> Alcohol use – the risk increases as more alcohol is consumed, so if you want to decrease your risk from alcohol, you should drink as little as possible or not at all.
> Childbirth – you have never had children or you had your first child after the age of 30.  It has also been found that having more than one child decreases your risk of breast cancer.  
> DES exposure – you were given diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent a miscarriage.  
> Hormone therapy – you have taken estrogen hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for many years.  
> Obesity – you are obese.  Some have noted that fat cells produce more estrogen, which increases the growth of certain types of breast cancer.
> Radiation – you underwent radiation treatment, especially if you received the radiation as a child or young adult.  
There are no conclusive links between breast cancer and underwire bras, antiperspirant, or breast implants.  

There are things you can do to decrease your risk of developing breast cancer or help you catch it at a very early (curable) stage.  
> Get screening mammograms as recommended by your healthcare provider.
> Make lifestyle changes that include limiting your alcohol intake, exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight.  
> Discuss the pros and cons of hormone therapy after menopause with your healthcare provider.
> If you have a family history of breast cancer, discuss the pros and cons of genetic testing with your healthcare provider.
> If you are at high risk for developing breast cancer, discuss possible preventive medications and surgeries with your healthcare provider.   

It is also important that you are aware of how your breasts normally look and feel.  There are frequently no symptoms in the early stages of breast cancer.  Symptoms that require medical attention include: a lump in the breast or armpit; a change in the appearance of the breast or nipple (redness, dimples, or puckering); or bloody, clear, yellow, or green discharge from the nipple.  Your healthcare provider will perform a physical examination of your breasts, underarms, neck, and chest.  They may also recommend one of the following tests:  
> mammography to screen for and evaluate breasts lumps
> an MRI of the breast to screen women at high risk or evaluate an abnormality in the breast
> an ultrasound of the breast to determine if a lump is solid or filled with fluid
> the removal of tissue for examination under a microscope (biopsy)
A biopsy is needed to determine if a lump or other abnormality is cancer.  If your breast biopsy indicates you do have breast cancer, additional testing will most likely be needed.

If your healthcare provider recommends a breast biopsy, prior to the procedure you should tell them about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  You should also ask about specific instructions you should follow before and after the procedure.  These include:
> medications you should not take before the procedure, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the procedure","In most cases, a breast biopsy is very safe.  There are rarely serious complications, but you should be aware of the risks and talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have.  Some of the potential risks are:
> infection
> bleeding that may need to be controlled by sealing off the blood vessel (cautery)
> a reaction to the sedation and breathing problems  
You should let your healthcare provider know if you have any signs of infection (fever, excessive pain, or discharge) or significant bleeding.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of breast cancer.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you’ve had them.

M,CR002,Cancer - Breast - Mastectomy - Single,Cancer of Breast | Ductal Cancer | Lobular Cancer | HER2-Positive Cancer | ER-Positive Cancer | In Situ | BRCA1 | BRCA2 | Mastectomy | Removal of Breast | Breast Removal,https://client.myoptumhealth.com/myoptumhealth/guest/page.esync?view=prelogin.learn.learnLanding&command=DiseasesAndConditions&article=d5796305c4259110VgnVCM1000005220720a____#.UV2xbIYemMI.email,"Breast cancer refers to the growth of abnormal cells in the breast, often referred to as a malignant or cancerous tumor.  The breast is made up of lobules (glands that make milk), ducts (tubes that transport milk to the nipple), and stroma (tissue that surrounds and supports the ducts and lobules).  Although cancer can develop in any area of the breast, the two most common areas are the ducts (ductal carcinoma) and lobules (lobular carcinoma). 
> Breast cancer that is only present in its initial location, and has not spread to other areas of the breast, is called noninvasive or “in situ.”  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is cancer that has started in the milk ducts, but has not yet spread to tissues outside the duct.  DCIS can progress to invasive cancer if it is not treated.  Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is the presence of abnormal cells in the breast lobules.  These abnormal cells are not cancer, but their presence increases the risk of invasive cancer developing in the future.  LCIS is therefore considered a “marker” for the development of invasive cancer in either breast.
> Breast cancer that has spread from its initial location in the ducts or lobules to other areas of the breast is called invasive or infiltrating.  The two most common types of invasive breast cancer are infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) and infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC).  
> Estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) and progesterone receptor-positive (PR-positive) breast cancers are sensitive to specific hormones.  This means the hormones encourage the growth of the cancers and these cancers can be treated with medications that block the effects of estrogen.  If breast cancer is not sensitive to the female hormone estrogen, it is called estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative).  If breast cancer is not sensitive to progesterone, it is called progesterone receptor-negative (PR-negative).   
> Human Epidermal Factor Receptor 2-positive (HER2-positive) breast cancer indicates the presence of a gene that encourages the growth of breast cancer cells.  HER2-positive breast cancer tends to grow faster, be more invasive, and have an increased chance of returning.  Three new drugs that target this gene are available today and have been quite effective in reducing the risk associated with this form of breast cancer..  
> Triple negative breast cancer is cancer that is negative for both of the hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) and human epidermal factor receptor (HER2).  This type of breast cancer can often be more aggressive and challenging to treat than other types of breast cancer.  Therefore, the response to treatment and overall prognosis may be less favorable than cancers that are not triple negative.  
> In some cases, cancer cells block lymph vessels in the breast.  This blockage leads to a reddened, inflamed breast.  When this redness occurs, the condition is called inflammatory breast cancer.  Inflammatory breast cancer also tends to be an aggressive form of breast cancer that requires treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.

Breast Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the breast cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called “staging.”  Typically, breast cancer first spreads to the lymph glands under the arm. In advanced cases breast cancer can involve the bones, lung, liver, brain and other organs.
> Metastatic breast cancer is cancer that started in the breast and has spread to other organs.  
> In early cases of breast cancer (lumps smaller than 5 cm in size) it is usually not necessary to do additional imaging studies to check for other cancers because spread is quite rare.  
In order to decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific breast cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Does the breast cancer invade outside the milk ducts or is it limited to the inside of the milk ducts?
> How large is the primary cancer in the breast?
> Has the cancer spread to lymph glands under the arm or anywhere else in the body?
> Does the breast cancer have receptors for estrogen and progesterone? The presence of these hormone receptors suggest a less aggressive cancer.
> Does the cancer have large amounts of the HER2 gene?  

Breast Cancer Surgical Treatments
A mastectomy involves the surgical removal of varying amounts of breast tissue, usually after a diagnosis of breast cancer.  However, there are rare instances when a mastectomy is done for women with a very high risk of breast cancer to decrease their chances of developing breast cancer.  
> There are several types of mastectomies.  The type your healthcare provider recommends will depend on your specific circumstances and your personal preferences.  In addition to the factors listed above, you and the surgeon must also consider how large your breast is, your age, family history, and general health.  In most cases, women will have a choice between a lumpectomy and a modified radical mastectomy.  Your personal preferences will affect that choice.   
> If approximately one quarter of the breast is removed, the surgery is known as a lumpectomy or quadrantectomy .  Another name for this procedure is breast conserving surgery.  When breast conserving surgery is an option (e.g., for women with early stage breast cancer or smaller tumors) the cure rate is similar to that of a mastectomy.   However, this type of surgery usually requires radiation therapy to the breast after surgery. The decision is based on patient preference.
  > If the entire breast and lymph nodes from under the arm are removed, it is called a modified radical mastectomy.  This approach and the lumpectomy are the most common surgeries for breast cancer. 
There are other surgeries that are not commonly used for breast cancer.     
> If the entire breast is removed, but the nipple and area that surrounds it (areola) are left, it is called a subcutaneous mastectomy.  This procedure is not commonly done for breast cancer.
> If the entire breast, including the nipple and area that surrounds it (areola) is removed, it is called a simple or total mastectomy.  
> If the entire breast, lymph nodes from under the arm, and underlying chest muscle are removed, it is called a radical mastectomy.  This type of surgery is now  rarely used.  
After a mastectomy, a drain is usually placed to drain excess fluid and the incision is closed with sutures.  Reconstruction is optional and is a personal decision.  It can be done right after a mastectomy, a few months later, or not at all.

> Make lifestyle changes that include limiting your alcohol intake, exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight.  
> Discuss the pros and cons of hormone therapy after menopause with your healthcare provider.
> If you have a family history of breast cancer, discuss the pros and cons of genetic testing with your healthcare provider.
> If you are at high risk for developing breast cancer, discuss possible preventive medications and surgeries with your healthcare provider. 
  
There are frequently no symptoms in the early stages of breast cancer, which is why appropriate screening can be important.  Some of the symptoms that can develop as the cancer grows include:
> a lump in the breast or armpit
> a change in the appearance of the breast or nipple (redness, dimples, or puckering)
> bloody, clear, yellow, or green discharge from the nipple
As the cancer advances, pain in the breast or bones, sores or ulcers on the skin, swelling under the arm next to the breast with cancer, or unexplained weight loss can develop.

You should contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms.  They will perform a physical examination of your breasts, underarms, neck, and chest.  They may also recommend one of the following tests:  
> mammography to screen for and evaluate breasts lumps
> an MRI of the breast to screen women at high risk or evaluate an abnormality in the breast
> an ultrasound of the breast to determine if a lump is solid or filled with fluid
> the removal of tissue for examination under a microscope (biopsy)
After your diagnosis and treatment has begun, your healthcare provider may also recommend the following if you have specific symptoms or a large cancer:
> a CT scan to determine if the cancer has spread
> a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to determine if the cancer has spread
> a lymph node biopsy to determine if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes

The treatment for breast cancer is based on many factors that include your age, if you have gone through menopause, the type and stage of the cancer, if the cancer is hormone sensitive, whether the gene called HER2 is overproduced, and other tests that determine the specific characteristics of the cancer.  The treatments are either local (only affects the area of the cancer) or systemic (affects all areas of the body).  Some of the local treatments include surgery to remove the cancer and radiation to kill the cancer cells.  Some of the systemic treatments for breast cancer are chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells, hormone therapy to block the effect of hormones that increase cancer growth, and targeted or biologic therapy to interfere with the changes in cells that help sustain the cancer.  Treatment for breast cancer usually involves a combination of local and systemic treatments.  
> If a mastectomy is performed, breast reconstructive surgery can be done at the time of surgery or after recovery.  
> You may be receiving more than one type of cancer treatment at a time.  Depending on your specific circumstances, you may alternate between chemotherapy and radiation treatment before or after surgery.  
> Chemotherapy can help stop a cancer from returning (improve the cure rate), stop it from spreading, slow its growth, or control the symptoms of a cancer that is not curable.  It can be given before or after surgery, at the same time someone is receiving radiation, or before and after radiation therapy.  It can also be combined with other forms of medication, such as hormone therapy.  
> There are many different combinations of chemotherapy medications, so the costs can vary widely from one patient to another.
> Radiation and chemotherapy are usually given in a physician clinic or hospital by specially trained medical personnel.  In some cases, you may be able to receive chemo at home with the help of specially trained nurses.  
> To get a full range of opinions and perspectives, you may want to consider input from a variety of doctors, such as your primary care physician, a medical oncologist (a doctor who specializes in the treatment of cancer), a surgeon with experience in breast cancer, a radiation oncologist (a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy), and a genetic counselor.

If your healthcare provider recommends a mastectomy, prior to the surgery you should tell them about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  You should also ask about specific instructions you should follow before and after the surgery.  These include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery from surgical procedures.
During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia is the most common type of anesthesia for a mastectomy. With this type of anesthesia, you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
Recovery from a mastectomy typically takes 4 to 6 weeks.  You may need pain medication and help at home while you recover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

It is important to remember that the total cost of this care path does not include all possible medications, lab work, or imaging studies; those charges can add up.  If your healthcare provider recommends any lab work or imaging studies, you may need to search for their costs separately.","The risks associated with having a mastectomy are generally the same as other major operations.  They include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and infections. Risks specific to a mastectomy include infection, pain or stiffness in the upper arm on the side of the surgery, swelling of the arm on the side of the surgery, and nerve damage on the side of the surgery.  

You may need other types of treatment for your breast cancer.  All of the treatments for breast cancer can have side effects that may affect your recovery.  It is important to remember that treatment is usually prescribed when it is felt that the benefits will significantly outweigh the risks.
> Chemotherapy can result in nausea and vomiting, mouth sores, increased risk of infection (impaired immune function), loss of hair, and other side effects.  Targeted therapy usually has a different range of side effects from traditional chemotherapy.
> Radiation therapy can result in burns, fatigue, and damage to the heart and other organs.  
> Hormone therapy can result in increased weight, blood clots, and possible increased risk of other cancers.  
> Aromatase inhibitors, a medication used to treat ER-positive breast cancer, can cause aches and pains in the muscles and bones, as well as thinning of bones.

The prognosis for women with breast cancer is improving and new treatments are helping them live longer.  Over 70 percent of women who develop breast cancer now become long-term breast cancer survivors.  Some of the factors that can affect the prognosis include where the tumor is located and if it has spread to surrounding tissue; the size of the tumor; if the tumor is hormone sensitive or resistant (ER and/or PR-positive or negative); the presence of other tumor markers (HER2-positive or negative); genetics; and how fast the tumor is growing.  
> Breast cancer can spread to other areas of the body.  It can also come back after a tumor has been removed and the lymph nodes have been found to be free of cancer cells.

There are many support groups to help cancer survivors and their families; some of these groups are attended online or by phone.  Attending these groups can allow you to meet with others who are going through the same things you are, so you don’t feel so alone.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of breast cancer.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you’ve had them. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects or precautions).
> If your healthcare provider wants you to take a medication, ask if an over-the-counter product is right for you.
> If your healthcare provider prescribes a medication for you, ask for a generic version. If your doctor thinks that a generic version is not right for you, ask for a medication on the lowest available tier of your Prescription Drug List (PDL).

What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a mastectomy?
> What is my diagnosis (specific type of breast cancer, if present) and reason for the surgery?  
> Do I need to fast before the surgery and, if so, for how long?  Is there any other special preparation for the surgery?  (If so, get clear instructions on what you need to do.)  What kind of sedation will I have? What are the possible side effects?
> What are the possible complications, how will I feel after the surgery, and how will I have to modify my activity?  Don’t forget to make arrangements for transportation to and from the facility and for help at home.
> Will I be receiving other treatments before or after my surgery?

Make a list of your questions/concerns/symptoms and medications (including over-the-counter). Verify which medications you should take before the surgery.  After your surgery, you should know what you had done, what medication was given, and what symptoms you should report to your healthcare provider. You should also understand all home care instructions (including medications and side effects) and follow-up plans.",19303,This surgery involves the removal of varying amounts of breast tissue.

M,CR003,Cancer - Breast - Radiation,Cancer of Breast | Ductal Cancer | Lobular Cancer | HER2-Positive Cancer | ER-Positive Cancer | In Situ | BRCA1 | BRCA2 | Radiotherapy | Radio Therapy,https://client.myoptumhealth.com/myoptumhealth/guest/page.esync?view=prelogin.learn.learnLanding&command=DiseasesAndConditions&article=d5796305c4259110VgnVCM1000005220720a____#.UV2xbIYemMI.email,"Breast cancer refers to the growth of abnormal cells in the breast, often referred to as a malignant or cancerous tumor.  The breast is made up of lobules (glands that make milk), ducts (tubes that transport milk to the nipple), and stroma (tissue that surrounds and supports the ducts and lobules).  Although cancer can develop in any area of the breast, the two most common areas are the ducts (ductal carcinoma) and lobules (lobular carcinoma). 
> Breast cancer that is only present in its initial location, and has not spread to other areas of the breast, is called noninvasive or “in situ.”  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is cancer that has started in the milk ducts, but has not yet spread to tissues outside the duct.  DCIS can progress to invasive cancer if it is not treated.  Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is the presence of abnormal cells in the breast lobules.  These abnormal cells are not cancer, but their presence increases the risk of invasive cancer developing in the future.  LCIS is therefore considered a “marker” for the development of invasive cancer in either breast.
> Breast cancer that has spread from its initial location in the ducts or lobules to other areas of the breast is called invasive or infiltrating.  The two most common types of invasive breast cancer are infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) and infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC).  
> Estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) and progesterone receptor-positive (PR-positive) breast cancers are sensitive to specific hormones.  This means the hormones encourage the growth of the cancers and these cancers can be treated with medications that block the effects of estrogen.  If breast cancer is not sensitive to the female hormone estrogen, it is called estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative).  If breast cancer is not sensitive to progesterone, it is called progesterone receptor-negative (PR-negative).   
> Human Epidermal Factor Receptor 2-positive (HER2-positive) breast cancer indicates the presence of a gene that encourages the growth of breast cancer cells.  HER2-positive breast cancer tends to grow faster, be more invasive, and have an increased chance of returning.  Three new drugs that target this gene are available today and have been quite effective in reducing the risk associated with this form of breast cancer..  
> Triple negative breast cancer is cancer that is negative for both of the hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) and human epidermal factor receptor (HER2).  This type of breast cancer can often be more aggressive and challenging to treat than other types of breast cancer.  Therefore, the response to treatment and overall prognosis may be less favorable than cancers that are not triple negative.  
> In some cases, cancer cells block lymph vessels in the breast.  This blockage leads to a reddened, inflamed breast.  When this redness occurs, the condition is called inflammatory breast cancer.  Inflammatory breast cancer also tends to be an aggressive form of breast cancer that requires treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.

Breast Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the breast cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called “staging.”  Typically, breast cancer first spreads to the lymph glands under the arm. In advanced cases breast cancer can involve the bones, lung, liver, brain and other organs.
> Metastatic breast cancer is cancer that started in the breast and has spread to other organs.  
> In early cases of breast cancer (lumps smaller than 5 cm in size) it is usually not necessary to do additional imaging studies to check for other cancers because spread is quite rare.  
In order to decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific breast cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Does the breast cancer invade outside the milk ducts or is it limited to the inside of the milk ducts?
> How large is the primary cancer in the breast?
> Has the cancer spread to lymph glands under the arm or anywhere else in the body?
> Does the breast cancer have receptors for estrogen and progesterone? The presence of these hormone receptors suggest a less aggressive cancer.
> Does the cancer have large amounts of the HER2 gene?  

Breast Cancer Non-Surgical Treatments
Radiation therapy involves the use of various forms of radiation, or high-energy x-ray beams, to kill cancer cells in a specific area of the body.  It can be used to cure a cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or as an alternative to surgery.  It can also be used to decrease symptoms that are related to a tumor.  Radiation can also be given before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery to prevent cancer from returning.  It may also be used to simply relieve symptoms of a progressive cancer.  It can be given simultaneously with chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy can be given in various ways, depending on what type of cancer you have and where it is located in your body.  
> Radiation therapy to treat breast cancer is usually given externally by a machine that is located outside the body.  The machine sends high energy x-ray beams to the tumor.  These beams can kill the cancer cells and result in a tumor that shrinks or even disappears.  These x-ray beams must pass through normal tissue on their way to the cancer and out of the body.  The radiation that passes through these normal organs can cause damage if the dosage is too high.  Radiation oncologists plan the treatments to minimize the amount of radiation exposure to normal organs.  The treatments must be given daily over several weeks because normal tissues don’t tolerate a large dosage given at one time. 
> Three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation uses a beam that goes straight through the body.  The patient’s position is changed so this beam comes through from two or three different angles.  The approach is planned to allow the maximum exposure of radiation to the tumor.
> Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses hundreds of angles to accomplish the same task.  It is far more expensive and is used when many angles are necessary.  This approach helps to spare an important organ that is not affected by the cancer.  In IMRT the intensity of the beam is varied to conform to the shape of the tumor. The aim is to limit damage to surrounding healthy tissues, while effectively treating the cancer.  IMRT is a valuable technique for treating a small percentage of cancerous tumors, but adds little value in the treatment of others.  IMRT may not be covered by your health plan unless certain criteria are met.  
> Brachytherapy applies the radiation source immediately next to the area being treated.  Most brachytherapy for breast cancer is given at the time of surgery.  Early studies suggested that this approach was as effective as external 3D conformal or IMRT and it did not require the additional weeks of therapy.  However, studies are now showing that the local recurrence rate of breast cancer may be higher with this approach.  
>  The decision to administer radiation therapy will depend on the type of surgery used for breast cancer.  A lumpectomy almost always requires an additional 4-6 weeks of radiation therapy to prevent any local recurrence of the breast cancer.  Depending on the tumor stage, patients with modified radical mastectomies may also require radiation therapy after their surgery.
> Radiation can also be given internally by placing special radioactive source near a tumor (called brachytherapy), orally in the form of a pill or capsule that is swallowed, or infusion of a radioactive substance into a vein.","There are many risk factors that increase your chance of getting breast cancer.  These risks factors can be divided into those that you cannot control and those that you can control or eliminate.  Here are some of the uncontrollable risks factors for breast cancer.  
> Age – you have a higher risk as you age.
> Sex – although men can get breast cancer, women have a much higher risk.
> Family history – a close family member has had cancer of the breast, uterus, ovary, or colon.
> Genetics – you have a defect in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.  These genes produce a protein that helps protect the body from cancer.  Only about 1percentage of women with strong family histories of breast and ovarian cancer have this gene.
> Menstrual cycle – you started your period before you were 12 or went through menopause after you were 55.  This is thought to be due to the prolonged exposure to estrogen.  

Here are some of the controllable risks factors for breast cancer.  
> Alcohol use – the risk increases as more alcohol is consumed, so if you want to decrease your risk from alcohol, you should drink as little as possible or not at all.
> Childbirth – you have never had children or you had your first child after the age of 30.  It has also been found that having more than one child decreases your risk of breast cancer.  
> DES exposure – you were given diethylstilbestrol (DES) to prevent a miscarriage.  
> Hormone therapy – you have taken estrogen hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for many years.  
> Obesity – you are obese.  Some have noted that fat cells produce more estrogen, which increases the growth of certain types of breast cancer.
> Radiation – you underwent radiation treatment, especially if you received the radiation as a child or young adult.  
There are no conclusive links between breast cancer and underwire bras, antiperspirant, or breast implants.

There are things you can do to decrease your risk of developing breast cancer or help you catch it at a very early (curable) stage.  
> Get screening mammograms as recommended by your healthcare provider.
> Be aware of how your breasts normally look and feel, and report any changes to your healthcare provider.  
> Make lifestyle changes that include limiting your alcohol intake, exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight.  
> Discuss the pros and cons of hormone therapy after menopause with your healthcare provider.
> If you have a family history of breast cancer, discuss the pros and cons of genetic testing with your healthcare provider.
> If you are at high risk for developing breast cancer, discuss possible preventive medications and surgeries with your healthcare provider.

","Radiation therapy is carefully directed at a tumor, but it can damage and kill normal cells as well as cancer cells.  The side effects of radiation will depend on the radiation type, dose, frequency, and area of the body being treated.  Radiation given externally can lead to the following symptoms.  
> Changes in the skin where the radiation is directed (redness, thinning, or shedding) that looks like a bad sunburn.  Radiation oncologists prescribe creams to help with the healing process.
> Loss of hair (only if treatment is being given to the head).
> Fatigue, which usually gets progressively worse toward the end of treatment and resolves over the next 4-6 weeks. 
> Damage to normal organs if they are exposed to too much radiation.  The planning process for radiation therapy carefully creates a plan to avoid this exposure.  Normal organs can tolerate some radiation exposure without any long-term problems. A radiation plan is carefully created to avoid unnecessary exposure.

Skin cancer can be described as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or melanoma; the specific type of skin cancer is determined by the type of cell affected.  Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are often lumped together in a category called, “non-melanoma skin cancer.”
> Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer.  Basal cells are found in the lowest level of skin.
> Squamous cell carcinoma is made of a squamous cells, which are flat and form the top layer of the epidermis (the outermost portion of the skin).
> Melanoma is the least common, but most serious form of skin cancer.  It forms in pigment cells found in the lower part of the epidermis.  These cells are the ones that usually give skin its color (melanocytes) and is the form of skin cancer that is most likely to spread and result in death.  

A skin biopsy is the removal of a lesion or area of skin to check for abnormal, or cancerous, cells.  A skin biopsy can be done using various methods, depending on the type, area, and size of the lesion.  Most biopsies can be performed in a healthcare provider’s office, but in certain circumstances may need to be performed in an operating room.  
> Shave biopsy – The surgeon shaves off the top layer of skin.  No stitches are needed after this type of biopsy.
> Punch biopsy – The surgeon uses a sharp, hollow tube to remove a piece of a lesion.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the biopsy.  Depending on how much tissue is removed, sutures may or may not be needed.
> Excisional biopsy – The surgeon removes the entire lesion for testing.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the biopsy.  Sutures are usually needed; a skin graft may also be needed if the lesion is large.  
> Incisional biopsy – The surgeon removes a section of a lesion for testing.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the biopsy.  Depending on how much tissue is removed, sutures may or may not be needed.

Lesions that have been determined to be cancerous are frequently removed using a complex procedure known as “Mohs technique.”  Mohs technique is when the surgeon removes cancerous skin cells one layer at a time.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the procedure.  After each layer is removed, the tissue is immediately examined under a microscope to see if any cancer cells are present.  If cancer cells are seen, another layer of skin is removed and examined.  The steps continue until the microscopic examination does not reveal any cancer cells.  The wound is then either allowed to heal on its own or closed with sutures.  Your healthcare provider may recommend a skin biopsy and/or Mohs surgery if you have changes in your skin or a lesion (such as a mole) that appears suspicious or abnormal.  
> Mohs surgery is most often used in the removal of basal cell carcinomas.  
> The main advantage to the Mohs technique is that only diseased skin is removed from a specific area, saving as much normal skin as possible.  
> The Mohs technique allows the surgeon to get to the root of the cancer, which decreases the chance of it coming back.  
> Mohs surgery is usually performed in a healthcare provider’s office, but in certain circumstances may need to be performed in an operating room.","There are risk factors that can increase your chance of getting skin cancer.  Some of these risk factors are listed below. 
> Exposure – you spend a lot of time in the sun or get frequent sunburns.  This is the most common cause of skin cancer. Appropriate use of sunscreens can reduce this risk.
> Age – you have a higher risk as you age.
> Complexion – you have light eyes, skin, and hair.
> Family history – a family member has had melanoma.
> Immunologic status –  your immune system is suppressed.
It is important to remember that anyone can get skin cancer, even if they don’t have any risk factors.

There are some things you can do to decrease your risk of developing skin cancer or help you catch it at a very early (curable) stage.  
> Examine your skin on a monthly basis, using a mirror to see your back and other hard-to-see areas.
> Decrease your exposure to the sun.
> When you are out in the sun, cover as much of your skin as possible by wearing shirts with long sleeves, hats, and long pants.  
> Decrease your exposure to the sun during the middle of the day, as that is when the sun is the hottest.  
> Wear sun sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15; make sure you put sunscreen on a half hour before you go into the sun and reapply it frequently.  Don’t forget to use sunscreen in the winter months!

Some of the signs of skin cancer include lesions on the skin that are:
> scaly, shiny, or waxy
> firm, red, or rough
> different on one side than the other (asymmetrical) or have edges that are irregular
> oddly colored (can be brown, black, red, white, or blue)
> large, typically bigger than an eraser on a pencil
> not healing and tend to bleed
> changing or look different
You should contact your healthcare provider if you have any changes in an existing skin lesion or any of the above symptoms of skin cancer.

If your healthcare provider recommends a skin biopsy or Mohs surgery, prior to the procedure you should tell him or her about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  You should also ask if there are any specific instructions you should follow before and after the procedure.  These may include:
> medications you should not take before the procedure, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure","In most cases, a skin biopsy and Mohs surgery are safe.  There are rarely serious complications, but you should be aware of the risks and talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have.  Some of the potential risks are:
> infection
> scarring
> return of the skin cancer
You should let your healthcare provider know if you have any signs of infection (fever, excessive pain, or green discharge) or significant bleeding after the biopsy.  
If your biopsy is positive for skin cancer, the treatment is based on where it is located and whether it is a melanoma or nonmelanoma.  The prognosis depends on the specifics of the cancer and how quickly it was treated.  
> In most cases of non-melanomas, the main treatment is surgical removal of the lesion, which can be done using the Mohs technique when appropriate.  Non-melanomas are much less likely to spread, so their prognosis is usually very good.  
> Melanomas will most likely require additional testing and treatment after the lesion has been removed. Melanomas are more likely to spread to other areas of the body, so their prognosis is less certain.   

There are many support groups to help cancer survivors and their families; some of these groups are attended online or by phone.  Attending these groups can allow you to meet with others who are going through the same things you are, so you don’t feel so alone.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of skin cancer.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you’ve had them. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.

The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb), where it opens into the vaginal canal.  Your healthcare provider may recommend a cervical biopsy to check for cervical cancer if you have an abnormal Pap smear or pelvic exam.  In some cases, a cervical biopsy can be done in a healthcare provider’s office; however, some need to be performed in an operating room with medication to help you relax.  The type of biopsy recommended by your healthcare provider will determine where it can be performed. 
> Colposcopy directed biopsy – This type of cervical biopsy may be done in a healthcare provider’s office.  A special microscope (colposcope) is used to examine the cervix and identify any abnormal areas.  A sample of the abnormal tissue is then removed using small forceps or a special needle.
> Cervical punch (cone) biopsy – This type of cervical biopsy is usually done in the hospital after you have been given some medication to help you relax or sleep (anesthesia).  During the procedure, a cone-shaped piece of the cervix is removed for examination under a microscope.  If all of the abnormal tissue is removed, this procedure can also be seen as a primary treatment that could get rid of all abnormal tissue.
> In most cases, a colposcopy is uncomfortable, but not painful.  When a sample is taken, you may feel a pinching feeling.  Having cramping and slight bleeding after the biopsy is common.
The costs for this care path are for a cone biopsy, performed in an outpatient facility. ","Routine Pap smears have decreased the incidence of cervical cancer in the United States.  This is because cervical cancers typically evolve slowly and Pap spears can detect pre-cancerous lesions early when they are treatable.  That is why routine Pap smears are so important.  Here are some of the risks factors for cervical cancer.
> HPV (human papilloma virus) – a specific type (strain) of the HPV virus, which is spread during sexual intercourse, is the most common cause of cervical cancer.  A vaccine has been developed to prevent HPV infection and decrease the chance of developing cervical cancer.  
> Sexual activity –you began having sex at an early age.  
> High-risk sexual activity – you or your partner have multiple sex partners or engage in other high-risk sexual activities.  
> Smoking – you are a smoker.  
> DES exposure – your mother took DES when she was pregnant.  
> Weak immune system – your immune system is weak due to medications or illness.
> Lower economic status – may possibly be due to lack of insurance and/or inability to pay for routine Pap smears.  

There are things you can do to decrease your risk of developing cervical cancer or help you catch it at a very early (curable) stage.

There are frequently no symptoms in the early stages of cervical cancer.  Symptoms that can occur include: 
> constant vaginal discharge that can smell badly and vary in color from pale to brown 
> vaginal bleeding between menses or after sexual activity
> vaginal bleeding after menopause  
As the cancer advances, other symptoms can develop, such as decreased appetite, weight loss, feeling tired all the time, lower back and leg pain, a leg that is swollen, inability to hold urine or stool, and bone fractures.  

Contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms, Your healthcare provider will perform a physical examination and Pap smear to see if there are any abnormal cells on your cervix.  They may also recommend one of the following tests:  
> endocervical curettage (ECC), which helps the doctor examine the opening of the cervix
> the removal of tissue for examination under a microscope (biopsy)

The female reproductive system has two ovaries, two fallopian tubes, and a uterus (womb).  The ovaries are where human eggs are made. The fallopian tubes provide a pathway for the eggs to travel from the ovaries to the uterus. The uterus is where a baby grows during pregnancy.  The cervix is the lower part of the uterus, where it opens into the vaginal canal.    
> Cervical cancer typically starts with cells that are not normal, but they are not yet cancerous (dysplasia). 
> If these abnormal cells are detected and destroyed early, before they become cancerous, future cervical cancer can be prevented.  Even when cervical cancer is present, when it is in its early stages, it is highly curable..  
> Most cases of cervical cancer are found in women who have not had routine Pap smears or have not had abnormal results evaluated and treated when they are discovered.  

Cervical Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the cervical cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called “staging.”  In advanced cases, cervical cancer can involve the bladder and other pelvic organs and tissues, lungs, and liver.
> Metastatic cervical cancer is cancer that started in the cervix and has spread to other organs.  
To decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific cervical cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  
> How large is the primary cancer in the cervix?
> Has the cancer spread to the nearby lymph glands or anywhere else in the body?
> Does the patient want to have children in the future?

Cervical Cancer Surgical Treatments
The main surgery to treat cervical cancer that has already spread outside the cervix is a hysterectomy.  An abdominal hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus through an incision in the lower abdomen.  The incision can be in the lower abdomen along the bikini line (straight across or horizontal). It can also be in the area of the belly button (straight down or vertical).  The type of incision is based on the reason for the surgery, previous surgeries, and patient preference.  
> The ovaries and fallopian tubes may or may not be removed at the same time as the uterus.  
> You and your healthcare provider should discuss what alternative treatments might be available to you, especially if you hope to have children in the future.
> If you need a hysterectomy, you and your doctor should discuss whether your ovaries and fallopian tubes should also be removed.  If you have not gone through menopause and your ovaries are removed, you may need to take hormone supplements to avoid the symptoms of early menopause and bone loss. 

There are other procedures that can destroy abnormal cervical cells before they have spread beyond the cervix. These procedures may be done without affecting a woman’s ability to have children in the future.  Three examples are:
> LEEP (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure), which uses an electrical probe to destroy abnormal cells
> Cryotherapy, which destroys abnormal cells by freezing them
> Laser therapy, which uses light to destroy abnormal tissue","Routine Pap smears have decreased the incidence of cervical cancer in the United States.

A biopsy is needed to determine if an abnormality is cancer.  If your cervical biopsy indicates you do have cervical cancer, additional testing (CT scan, cystoscopy, MRI, and intravenous pyelogram) may be needed.

The treatment for cervical cancer is based on many factors that include your age and general health, your desire to have children in the future, the size of the tumor, how fast it is growing, and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.  The treatments are either local (only affects the area of the cancer) or systemic (affects all areas of the body).  Some of the local treatments include surgery to remove the cancer and radiation therapy to kill the cancer.  The systemic treatment for cervical cancer is chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells and targeted therapy, which targets the changes inside cells that make them cancerous.  Treatment for cervical cancer can involve a combination of local and systemic treatments.  
> Targeted therapy has been approved for advanced cervical cancer.    
> You may be receiving more than one type of cancer treatment at a time.  Depending on your specific circumstances, you may alternate between chemotherapy and radiation treatment before or after surgery.  
> Chemotherapy can help stop a cancer from returning (improve the cure rate), stop it from spreading, slow its growth, or control the symptoms of a cancer that is not curable.  It can be given before or after surgery, at the same time someone is receiving radiation, or before and after radiation therapy.  It can also be combined with other forms of medication, such as hormone therapy.  
> There are many different combinations of chemotherapy medications, so the costs can vary widely from one patient to another.
> Radiation and chemotherapy are usually given in a physician clinic or hospital by specially trained medical personnel.  In some cases, you may be able to receive chemo at home with the help of specially trained nurses.  
> To get a full range of opinions and perspectives, you may want to consider input from a variety of doctors, such as your primary care physician, a medical oncologist (a doctor who specializes in the treatment of cancer), a surgeon with experience in cervical cancer, a radiation oncologist (a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy), a gynecologist, and a gynecologic oncologist (a doctor who specializes in treatment of cancers of the female organs).

If your healthcare provider recommends a hysterectomy, prior to the surgery tell them about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  You should also ask about specific instructions to follow before and after the surgery.  These may include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery from surgical procedures.
During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia is the most common type of anesthesia for a hystere+G:Gctomy. With this type of anesthesia, you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
To prevent complications, it is important you get out of bed and walk as soon as possible.  
Although you will only be in the hospital for a few days, full recovery from a hysterectomy typically takes a couple of months.  You will most likely need pain medication and help at home while you recover.

It is important to remember that the total cost of this care path does not include all possible medications, labwork, or imaging studies; those charges can add up.  If your healthcare provider recommends any labwork or imaging studies you may need to search for their costs separately.","Although it is a major surgery, in most cases a hysterectomy is safe.  However, the outcome can depend on age, lifestyle (including smoking), reason for the hysterectomy (including stage of cancer), other treatments that may be recommended (chemotherapy, radiation), and overall physical and mental health.  There are several significant risks that you should be aware of and discuss with your healthcare provider.  
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and various infections.  Risks specific to this type of surgery include infection, painful intercourse and decreased interest in sex, damage to the organs near the uterus, and risks associated with early menopause (if ovaries are removed before natural menopause).
> If the ovaries are removed in a woman who has not yet gone through menopause, estrogen therapy can help decrease the symptoms and risks associated with early menopause, including heart disease.  
> After a hysterectomy, some younger women feel anxious, depressed, or sad about their inability to have children in the future.  If you have any of these feelings, talk about them with your healthcare provider.  

You may need other types of treatment for your cervical cancer.  All of the treatments for cervical cancer can have side effects that may affect your recovery.  It is important to remember that treatment is usually prescribed when it is felt that the benefits will significantly outweigh the risks.
> Chemotherapy can result in severe nausea and vomiting, increased risk of infection (impaired immune function), and loss of hair, and other side effects.  Targeted therapy usually has a different range of side effects from traditional chemotherapy.
> Radiation therapy can result in burns, fatigue, and damage to other organs in your abdomen (bowels and bladder).
The prognosis for people with cervical cancer depends on the type and stage of the cancer, as well as the woman’s age and overall health.  Some cervical cancers are not cured and can return after treatment.  The chance of this happening are higher if the uterus is not removed.   

There are many support groups to help cancer survivors and their families; some of these groups are attended online or by phone.  Attending these groups can allow you to meet with others who are going through the same things you are, so you don’t feel so alone.","Contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of cervical cancer.

Here are some of the risks factors for colon cancer.  
> Age – you have a higher risk as you age.
> Family history – a close family member has had cancer of the colon or has been diagnosed with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome).  
> Medical history – you have a history of breast cancer, polyps in your colon, or inflammatory bowel disease.
> Race – you are African American or from Eastern Europe.  
> Diet – you eat red meat or meat that is processed.  High-fat and low-fiber diets may also play a role in the development of colon cancer, but the link between colon cancer and low-fiber diets is not clear.  
> Alcohol use – you drink excessive amounts of alcohol.  
> Smoking – you smoke.  

To decrease your risk of developing colon cancer or to diagnose it at a very early (curable) stage, you should have screening sigmoidoscopies, colonoscopies, and/or stool tests for occult (not visible) blood at intervals recommended by your healthcare provider.  In addition, you should try to make lifestyle changes that include limiting your alcohol intake, exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight.  Eating a low-fat and high-fiber diet may help decrease your colon cancer risk.  
> Having colon cancer screening, which often includes a colonoscopy, can also reduce your risk of dying from colon cancer.
> Most people should have their first colon cancer screening beginning at age 50, but screening can be done earlier in individuals who are at high risk for colon cancer.  It is important to discuss the right age to begin screening with your healthcare provider.

If your healthcare provider recommends a colon biopsy, prior to the procedure you should tell him/her about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Some medicines can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation or the exam.  The day before the exam, you will drink only clear liquids and take medicine to clean out your bowels.  Just before the test, you may be given a medicine that makes you relaxed and sleepy (a sedative) or one that puts you to sleep (anesthesia).  You should also ask about other specific instructions you should follow before and after the procedure.  These include:
> medications you should not take before the procedure, such as blood thinners

The bowel is made up of the small intestine (where most of the nutrients are absorbed), the large intestine or colon (where most of the water is reabsorbed and stool is stored), and the rectum (where stool is stored until it is eliminated from the body).  The lining of the colon and rectum are where most colon cancers begin.  The development of a cancer usually begins with the formation of a polyp, a noncancerous piece of tissue that grows out from the lining of the bowel.  
> From its initial location in the bowel, colon cancer can spread or metastasize to lymph nodes and other organs or tissues. 
> There are blood tests to look for tumor markers that can help your healthcare provider monitor your status before, during, and after treatment.  These tests are called carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9.  

Colon Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the colon cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called “staging.”  
> Metastatic colon cancer is cancer that started in the colon and has spread to other organs.  
In order to decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific colon cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Does the colon cancer invade outside the large intestines ducts or is it limited to the large intestines?
> How large is the primary cancer in the colon?
> Has the cancer spread to lymph glands or anywhere else in the body?

Colon Cancer Surgical Treatments
A colectomy is the removal of varying amounts of the large intestine through an incision in the abdomen.  How much of the large intestine that is removed depends on your specific circumstances.  The factors that will determine the right procedure for you include the size of the tumor; where it is located; and your age, family history, and general health.    
> If the entire large intestine is removed, it is called a total colectomy.  
> If only a part of the large intestine is removed, it is called a subtotal colectomy.
> In some cases a colectomy can be done using small medical instruments and a camera inserted into 3 or 4 small cuts in the abdomen; this is called laparoscopic, or minimally invasive, surgery.  > Laparoscopic surgery allows for a quicker recovery with less pain and scarring than open surgery. 
  
After the surgery, you will need to stay in the hospital for 3 to 7 days.  A couple of days after surgery, you will start with clear liquids and then slowly increase your diet as your bowel function returns toward normal.","There are many risk factors that increase your chance of getting colon cancer.  Here are some of the risks factors for colon cancer.  
> Age – you have a higher risk as you age.
> Family history – a close family member has had cancer of the colon or has been diagnosed with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome).  
> Medical history – you have a history of breast cancer, polyps in your colon, or inflammatory bowel disease.
> Race – you are African American or from Eastern Europe.  
> Diet – you eat red meat or meat that is processed.  High-fat and low-fiber diets may also play a role in the development of colon cancer, but the link between colon cancer and low-fiber diets is not clear.  
> Alcohol use – you drink excessive amounts of alcohol.  
> Smoking – you smoke.  

To decrease your risk of developing colon cancer or to diagnose it at a very early (curable) stage, you should have screening sigmoidoscopies, colonoscopies, and/or stool tests for occult (not visible) blood at intervals recommended by your healthcare provider.  In addition, you should try to make lifestyle changes that include limiting your alcohol intake, exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight.  Eating a low-fat and high-fiber diet may help decrease your colon cancer risk.  

There are frequently no symptoms in the early stages of colon cancer, which is why appropriate screening can be important.  Some of the symptoms that can develop as the cancer grows include:
> pain or discomfort in the lower part of the abdomen
> blood in the stool, or stools that are long and narrow
> changes in the bowel habits, such as constipation or diarrhea
> unexplained weight loss
As the cancer advances, other symptoms can develop.  You should contact your healthcare provider if you have any of these symptoms.  He or she will ask you questions and perform a physical examination.  They may also recommend one of the following tests:  
> colonoscopy and the removal of tissue for examination under a microscope (biopsy)
> lab tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC), liver panel, CEA, or CA 19-9
> CT, MRI, or positron emission tomography (PET) scan to determine if the cancer has spread

The treatment for colon cancer is based on many factors that include your age, overall health, and type and stage of the cancer.  The treatments are either local (only affects the area of the cancer) or systemic (affects all areas of the body).  Some of the local treatments include surgery to remove the cancer and radiation to kill the cancer cells.  The systemic treatments for colon cancer are chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells and targeted therapy, which targets the changes inside cells that make them cancerous.  Treatment for colon cancer usually involves a combination of local and systemic treatments.  
> Radiation may be used with chemotherapy if you have an aggressive cancer that has spread to the liver. If the cancer has spread to the liver, the liver is the organ that receives the radiation.     
> Targeted therapy has been approved for colon cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. > You may be receiving more than one type of cancer treatment at a time.  Depending on your specific circumstances, you may alternate between chemotherapy and radiation treatment before or after surgery.  
> Chemotherapy can help stop a cancer from returning (improve the cure rate), stop it from spreading, slow its growth, or control the symptoms of a cancer that is not curable.  It can be given before or after surgery, at the same time someone is receiving radiation, or before and after radiation therapy.  It can also be combined with other forms of medication.  
> There are many different combinations of chemotherapy medications, so the costs can vary widely from one patient to another.
> Chemotherapy is usually given in a physician clinic or hospital by specially trained medical personnel.  In some cases, you may be able to receive chemo at home with the help of specially trained nurses.  
> To get a full range of opinions and perspectives, you may want to consider input from a variety of doctors, such as your primary care physician, a medical oncologist (a doctor who specializes in the treatment of cancer), a surgeon with experience in breast cancer, a radiation oncologist (a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy), and a genetic counselor.

If your healthcare provider recommends a partial or total colectomy, prior to the surgery you should tell them about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  You should also ask about specific instructions you should follow before and after the surgery.  These include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your surgery
> what diet should follow the weeks before surgery
< what medicine or prep you will take to clean out your colon for surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery from surgical procedures.
During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia is the most common type of anesthesia for a colectomy. With this type of anesthesia, you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
Recovery from a colectomy typically takes 4 to 6 weeks.  You may need pain medication and help at home while you recover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

It is important to remember that the total cost of this care path does not include all possible medications, lab work, or imaging studies; those charges can add up.  If your healthcare provider recommends any lab work or imaging studies, you may need to search for their costs separately.
","The risks associated with having a colectomy are generally the same as other major operations.  The outcome can depend on age, lifestyle (including smoking), reason for the colectomy (including staging of cancer), other treatments that may be recommended (chemotherapy, radiation), and overall physical and mental health.  You should be aware of the risks and talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have.  
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and various infections.  Risks specific to a colectomy include bleeding in your abdomen, injury to other organs, development of scar tissue that blocks the intestines, infection, and opening of the incision.  
> You should let your healthcare provider know if you have any signs of infection (fever, excessive abdominal pain, or discharge from your incision), nausea and vomiting, constipation, or excessive diarrhea.  

You may need other types of treatment for your colon cancer.  All of the treatments for colon cancer can have side effects that may affect your recovery.  It is important to remember that treatment is usually prescribed when it is felt that the benefits will significantly outweigh the risks.
> Chemotherapy can result in nausea and vomiting, mouth sores, increased risk of infection (impaired immune function), loss of hair, and other side effects.  Targeted therapy usually has a different range of side effects from traditional chemotherapy.
> Radiation therapy can result in burns, fatigue, and damage to the bowel and other organs.
> Targeted therapy usually has a different range of side effects from traditional chemotherapy.

The prognosis for colon cancer is dependent on many factors, but it is generally good if it is found in the early stages.  If the cancer does not recur within 5 years, it is usually considered cured. Some of the complications of colon cancer include:
> inability of the stool to pass through the bowel (blockage or obstruction)
> return or spreading of the cancer to other areas of the body (metastasis), resulting in symptoms and problems with other organs or tissues
> a second cancer developing within the colon 

There are many support groups to help cancer survivors and their families; some of these groups are attended online or by phone.  Attending these groups can allow you to meet with others who are going through the same things you are, so you don’t feel so alone.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of colon cancer.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you’ve had them. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects or precautions).
> If your healthcare provider wants you to take a medication, ask if an over-the-counter product is right for you.
> If your healthcare provider prescribes a medication for you, ask for a generic version. If your doctor thinks that a generic version is not right for you, ask for a medication on the lowest available tier of your Prescription Drug List (PDL).

> What is my diagnosis (specific type of colon cancer, if present) and reason for the surgery?
> Do I need to fast before the surgery and, if so, for how long?  Is there any other special preparation for the surgery?  (If so, get clear instructions on what you need to do.)  What kind of sedation will I have? What are the possible side effects?
> What are the possible complications, how will I feel after the surgery, and how will I have to modify my activity?  Don’t forget to make arrangements for help at home.
> How will my diet change after the surgery?
> How will my bowel habits change?

To decrease your risk of developing cancer of the esophagus, you should quit smoking and limit the amount of alcohol you drink.  If you have problems with long-term reflux or have a diagnosis of Barrett’s esophagus, you may need to undergo periodic screenings for esophageal cancer.  Screenings are often done with an upper endoscopy and biopsy and can lead to an early diagnosis and improved survival.  The symptoms of esophageal cancer can include:
> reflux, or backwards movement of stomach contents into the esophagus
> trouble swallowing food or liquids
> heartburn

The esophagus is a tube that carries food from the mouth down to the stomach.  It is also known as the “food pipe.”  It contains muscles that move the food in one direction, from the mouth to the stomach, and help stop food from backing up into the throat and mouth (reflux).  
> Cancer of the esophagus is one of two types:  squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma.
> The cells that make up these two types of cancer look different when they are examined under a microscope.  

Esophagus Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the esophagus cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called “staging.”  In advanced cases cancer of the esophagus can involve other organs.
> Metastatic esophageal cancer is cancer that started in the esophagus and has spread to other organs.  
In order to decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific esophageal cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Does the cancer invade outside the esophagus?
> How large is the primary cancer in the esophagus?
> Has the cancer spread anywhere else in the body?

Esophagus Cancer Non-Surgical Treatments
Radiation therapy involves the use of various forms of radiation, or high-energy x-ray beams, to kill cancer cells in a specific area of the body.  It can be used to cure a cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or as an alternative to surgery.  It can also be used to decrease symptoms that are related to a tumor.  Radiation can also be given before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery to prevent cancer from returning.  It may also be used to simply relieve symptoms of a progressive cancer.  It can be given simultaneously with chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy can be given in various ways, depending on what type of cancer you have and where it is located in your body.    
> Radiation therapy to treat esophageal cancer is usually given externally by a machine that is located outside the body.  The machine sends high energy x-ray beams to the tumor.  These beams can kill the cancer cells and result in a tumor that shrinks or even disappears.  These x-ray beams must pass through normal tissue on their way to the cancer and out of the body.  The radiation that passes through these normal organs can cause damage if the dosage is too high.  Radiation oncologists plan the treatments to minimize the amount of radiation exposure to normal organs.  The treatments must be given daily over several weeks because normal tissues don’t tolerate a large dosage given at one time. 
> Three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation uses a beam that goes straight through the body.  The patient’s position is changed so this beam comes through from two or three different angles.  The approach is planned to allow the maximum exposure of radiation to the tumor.
> Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses hundreds of angles to accomplish the same task.  It is far more expensive and is used when many angles are necessary.  This approach helps to spare an important organ that is not affected by the cancer.  In IMRT the intensity of the beam is varied to conform to the shape of the tumor. The aim is to limit damage to surrounding healthy tissues, while effectively treating the cancer.  IMRT is a valuable technique for treating a small percentage of cancerous tumors, but adds little value in the treatment of others.  IMRT may not be covered by your health plan unless certain criteria are met.  
>  The decision to administer radiation therapy will depend on the individual circumstances.
> Radiation can also be given internally by placing special radioactive source near a tumor (called brachytherapy), orally in the form of a pill or capsule that is swallowed, or infusion of a radioactive substance into a vein.","The incidence of esophageal cancer in the United States is not very high, but occurrence is usually in men over the age of 50.  The risk factors for cancer of the esophagus depend on whether the cancer is squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma.

The systemic treatments for cancer of the esophagus are chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells and targeted therapy, which targets the changes inside cells that make them cancerous. 
> If the cancer is only in the esophagus, surgery is usually the primary treatment.  A dilation of the esophagus or injection of medication directly into the tumor, followed by a special light therapy, are other treatments that can help relieve symptoms.
> Targeted therapy has been approved for a certain type of cancer of the esophagus.    
> Chemotherapy can help stop a cancer from returning (improve the cure rate), stop it from spreading, slow its growth, or control the symptoms of a cancer that is not curable.  It can be given before or after surgery, at the same time someone is receiving radiation, or before and after radiation therapy.  It can also be combined with other forms of medication.

","Radiation therapy is carefully directed at a tumor, but it can damage and kill normal cells as well as cancer cells.  The side effects of radiation will depend on the radiation type, dose, frequency, and area of the body being treated.  Radiation given externally can lead to the following symptoms.  
> Changes in the skin where the radiation is directed (redness, thinning, or shedding) that looks like a bad sunburn.  Radiation oncologists prescribe creams to help with the healing process.
> Loss of hair (only if treatment is being given to the head).
> Fatigue, which usually gets progressively worse toward the end of treatment and resolves over the next 4-6 weeks. 
> Damage to normal organs if they are exposed to too much radiation.  The planning process for radiation therapy carefully creates a plan to avoid this exposure.  Normal organs can tolerate some radiation exposure without any long-term problems. A radiation plan is carefully created to avoid unnecessary exposure.

You may need other types of treatment for your esophageal cancer.  All of the treatments for esophageal cancer can have side effects that may affect your recovery.  It is important to remember that treatment is usually prescribed when it is felt that the benefits will significantly outweigh the risks.

The prognosis for people with cancer of the esophagus depends on the stage of the disease at diagnosis.  Like all cancers, it is better if it is caught early.  In recent years, improved treatment, which may involve surgery, radiation, and sometimes chemotherapy, has cured some people and allowed others to live longer and have a better quality of life after diagnosis.

The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of your neck.  Although the hormones produced by the thyroid gland effect many organs of the body, its main function is to control the body’s metabolism (how fast sources of energy are used).  It also helps control body temperature and the level of calcium in the blood.  Cancer of the thyroid can be one of four types.  
> Papillary carcinoma, the most common thyroid cancer, usually grows very slowly and is associated with a very high cure rate.  It is typically found in women of childbearing age, but can occur in men and other age groups.
> Medullary carcinoma is cancer of the cells in the thyroid that produce a hormone to help control the level of calcium in your blood.  It tends to grow slowly, but can be difficult to treat once it spreads.  This type of thyroid cancer can be inherited. 
> Follicular carcinoma is the second most common type of thyroid cancer.  It usually grows slowly and is usually cured when diagnosed early.
> Anaplastic carcinoma is also known as giant and spindle cell cancer.  It usually occurs in older people.  This is an uncommon, but very aggressive form of cancer that generally spreads quickly.  

Thyroid Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the thyroid cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called “staging.”  
> Metastatic thyroid cancer is cancer that started in the thyroid and has spread to other organs.  
In order to decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific thyroid cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Does the thyroid cancer invade outside the thyroid gland or is it limited to the gland itself?
> How large is the primary cancer in the thyroid?
> Has the cancer spread to lymph glands or anywhere else in the body?

Thyroid Cancer Surgical Treatment
A thyroidectomy is the removal of the thyroid gland through an incision in the neck.  It can be done to treat thyroid cancer, an overactive thyroid, a noncancerous thyroid growth, or swelling of the thyroid.  
> You may need to take thyroid medication and iodine for a period of time prior to the surgery.

Treatments for thyroid cancer are either local (only affects the area of the cancer) or systemic (affects all areas of the body).  Some of the local treatments include surgery to remove the cancer (thyroidectomy, or removal of the thyroid) and radiation (external) to kill the cancer.  The systemic treatments for thyroid cancer include chemotherapy; internal radiation, which is given orally (by mouth) as a solution and absorbed by certain cancerous tissue; and targeted therapy, which targets the changes inside cells that make them cancerous.  All 3 treatments target and kill cancer cells.    
> If the cancer is only in the thyroid, surgery is usually the primary treatment. 
> Treatment may involve a combination of local and systemic treatments, especially if the cancer has gone to other parts of your body.  
> Chemotherapy is not often used to treat thyroid cancer that has not spread. 
> Chemotherapy can help stop a cancer from returning (improve the cure rate), stop it from spreading, slow its growth, or control the symptoms of a cancer that is not curable.  It can be given before or after surgery, at the same time someone is receiving radiation, or before and after radiation therapy.  
> There are many different combinations of chemotherapy medications, so the costs can vary widely from one patient to another.
> Oral targeted therapy has been approved for medullary thyroid cancer.  Targeted therapy for other types of thyroid cancer also appears promising.  
> You may be receiving more than one type of cancer treatment at a time.  Depending on your specific circumstances, you may alternate between chemotherapy and radiation treatment before or after surgery.  > Radiation and chemotherapy are usually given in a clinic or hospital by specially trained medical personnel.  In some cases, you may be able to receive chemo at home with the help of specially trained nurses.  
> After treatment, you will need to take a thyroid medication for the rest of your life.
> To get a full range of opinions and perspectives, you may want to consider input from a variety of doctors, such as your primary care physician, a medical oncologist (a doctor who specializes in the treatment of cancer), a surgeon with experience in thyroid cancer, a radiation oncologist (a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy), and an endocrinologist.

If your healthcare provider recommends a thyroidectomy, prior to the surgery you should tell him or her about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  You should also ask about specific instructions you should follow before and after the surgery.  These include:
> medications you may need to take before the surgery
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery from surgical procedures
During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia is the most common type of anesthesia for a thyroidectomy. With this type of anesthesia, you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
Recovery from a thyroidectomy typically takes 3 to 4 weeks.  You may need pain medication and help at home while you recover.  

It is important to remember that the total cost of this care path does not include all possible medications, lab work, or imaging studies; those charges can add up.  If your healthcare provider recommends any lab work or imaging studies, you may need to search for their costs separately.
","The risks associated with having a mastectomy are generally the same as other major operations.  They include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and infections.  Risks specific to this type of surgery include an injury to the nerves that go to the vocal cords or larynx, which can cause voice and swallowing problems; trouble breathing (rare); bleeding, and dramatic shifts in thyroid hormone or calcium levels.  

You may need other types of treatment for your thyroid cancer.  All of the treatments for thyroid cancer can have different side effects that may affect your recovery.  It is important to remember that treatment is usually prescribed when it is felt that the benefits will significantly outweigh the risks.
> Chemotherapy can result in nausea and vomiting, increased risk of infection (impaired immune function), loss of hair, and other side effects.  Targeted therapy usually has a different range of side effects from traditional chemotherapy.
> External radiation therapy can result in burns, fatigue, and damage to the heart and other organs or tissues.  The side effects from internal radiation therapy depends on the area of the body receiving the radiation treatment.  Internal radiation therapy for thyroid cancer only targets the thyroid cells, so the side effects are rarely significant.  

The prognosis for people with thyroid cancer is generally very good.  Some of the factors that can affect your prognosis include the type of thyroid cancer you have, where the tumor is located, if it has spread to surrounding tissue, the size of the tumor, and how fast the tumor is growing.  Your age, lifestyle (including smoking), other treatments that may be recommended, and your overall physical and mental health can also affect your outcome.  

There are many support groups to help cancer survivors and their families; some of these groups are attended online or by phone.  Attending these groups can allow you to meet with others who are going through the same things you are, so you don’t feel so alone.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of thyroid cancer.

> How large is the primary cancer in the thyroid?
> Has the cancer spread to lymph glands or anywhere else in the body?

Thyroid Cancer Non-Surgical Treatment
Radiation therapy involves the use of various forms of radiation, or high-energy x-ray beams, to kill cancer cells in a specific area of the body.  It can be used to cure a cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or as an alternative to surgery.  It can also be used to decrease symptoms that are related to a tumor.  Radiation can also be given before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery to prevent cancer from returning.  It may also be used to simply relieve symptoms of a progressive cancer.  It can be given simultaneously with chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy can be given in various ways, depending on what type of cancer you have and where it is located in your body.  
> Radiation therapy to treat thyroid cancer is usually given externally by a machine that is located outside the body.  The machine sends high energy x-ray beams to the tumor.  These beams can kill the cancer cells and result in a tumor that shrinks or even disappears.  These x-ray beams must pass through normal tissue on their way to the cancer and out of the body.  The radiation that passes through these normal organs can cause damage.  Radiation oncologists plan the treatments to minimize the amount of radiation exposure to normal organs.  The treatments must be given daily over several weeks because normal tissues don’t tolerate a large dosage given at one time. 
> Three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation uses a beam that goes straight through the body.  The patient’s position is changed so this beam comes through from two or three different angles.  The approach is planned to allow the maximum exposure of radiation to the tumor.
> Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses hundreds of angles to accomplish the same task.  It is far more expensive and is used when many angles are necessary.  This approach helps to spare an important organ that is not affected by the cancer.  In IMRT the intensity of the beam is varied to conform to the shape of the tumor. The aim is to limit damage to surrounding healthy tissues, while effectively treating the cancer.  IMRT is a valuable technique for treating a small percentage of cancerous tumors, but adds little value in the treatment of others.  IMRT may not be covered by your health plan unless certain criteria are met.    
>  The decision to administer radiation therapy will depend on the individual circumstances.
> Radiation can also be given internally by placing special radioactive source near a tumor (called brachytherapy), orally in the form of a pill or capsule that is swallowed, or infusion of a radioactive substance into a vein.  
> Thyroid cancer is often treated by taking radioactive iodine orally (by mouth) as a solution.  The radioactive iodine is absorbed by the thyroid cells and destroys them.","Thyroid cancer can develop at any age, but it is most common in women between 40 and 50 years of age and men between 60 and 70 years of age.  The risk factors for cancer of the thyroid include:

","Radiation therapy is carefully directed at a tumor, but it can damage and kill normal cells as well as cancer cells.  The side effects of radiation will depend on the radiation type, dose, frequency, and area of the body being treated.  Radiation given externally can lead to the following symptoms.  
> Changes in the skin where the radiation is directed (redness, thinning, or shedding) that looks like a bad sunburn.  Radiation oncologists prescribe creams to help with the healing process.
> Loss of hair (only if treatment is being given to the head).
> Fatigue, which usually gets progressively worse toward the end of treatment and resolves over the next 4-6 weeks.

> Chronic bladder infections – you have a history of frequent or long-term bladder infections.
At this time, there is no conclusive evidence that links artificial sweeteners and bladder cancer.

The symptoms of bladder cancer can also be caused by other common bladder conditions, such as a urinary tract infection.  Some of these symptoms include: 
> urine that is bloody 
> pain when you urinate
> having to urinate frequently
> having to urinate urgently or quickly
As the cancer advances, other symptoms can develop. These symptoms may include weight loss, feeling tired all the time, pain or tenderness in your bones, inability to hold urine, anemia, and abdominal pain.  

Contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms.  He or she will review your symptoms and perform a physical examination.  Your provider may also recommend one of the following tests:
> an intravenous pyelogram (IVP)
> an examination of your
 bladder (cystoscopy) with removal of tissue for examination under a microscope (biopsy)
A biopsy is needed to determine if an abnormality is cancer.  If your bladder biopsy indicates you have bladder cancer, more testing (CT scan or MRI) may be needed.

If your healthcare provider recommends a bladder biopsy, it will probably be done during a cystoscopy.  A cystoscopy can either be performed with a rigid cystoscope or a flexible cystoscope.  If you are a male, you will need to lie on your back for the exam.  If you are a female and a rigid cystoscope is used, you will need to lie on your back with your feet in stirrups.  The position is the same as when you have a Pap smear or other vaginal exam.  
> You may experience some discomfort when the cystoscope is inserted and your bladder is filled with water or salt water.  Although filling your bladder is uncomfortable, it is necessary to see the entire lining of the bladder.
> You may experience a pinching sensation when a biopsy of abnormal tissue is taken.
> There may be a small amount of blood in your urine after the test. It may also hurt to urinate, but this discomfort should clear up after you urinate a few times.  Drinking 4 to 6 glasses or more of water a day after the test may help.  

Prior to the procedure, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  You should also ask about specific instructions to follow before and after the procedure.  These include:
> medications you should not take before the procedure, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the procedure","In most cases, a bladder biopsy is safe.  There are rarely serious complications, but you should be aware of the risks and talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have.  Some of the potential risks are:
> a bladder infection
> a tear in the wall of the bladder
> bleeding (especially if a biopsy is taken)
Let your healthcare provider know if you develop a fever, chills, pain or difficulty urinating after the procedure. ","Contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of bladder cancer.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you’ve had them. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms to report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis (if known), what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects or precautions).
> If your healthcare provider wants you to take a medication, ask if an over-the-counter product is right for you.
> If your healthcare provider prescribes a medication for you, ask for a generic version. If your doctor thinks that a generic version is not right for you, ask for a medication on the lowest available tier of your Prescription Drug List (PDL).

Bladder Cancer Surgical Treatments
There are several surgical treatments for bladder cancer. The surgery your healthcare provider recommends will depend on your specific circumstances and your personal preferences.

The cystoscope is inserted into the urethra and is then advanced into the bladder.  After the bladder is examined, an instrument is inserted into the bladder to either cut away the cancerous tissue away or to burn it (fulguration).

A biopsy is needed to determine if an abnormality is cancer.  If your bladder biopsy indicates you do have bladder cancer, additional testing (CT scan or MRI) may be needed.

The treatment for bladder cancer is based on many factors that include your age, your general health, your symptoms, and the type and stage of the cancer.  The treatments are either local (only affects the area of the cancer) or systemic (affects all areas of the body).  Some of the local treatments include surgery to only remove the cancer (cystoscopy with fulguration), surgery to remove the bladder (cystectomy), radiation to kill the cancer cells, and chemotherapy inserted directly into the bladder to kill the cancer cells.  Some of the systemic treatments for bladder cancer are immunotherapy to help your body kill the cancer cells, chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells, and targeted or biologic therapy to interfere with the changes in cells that help sustain the cancer.  Treatment for bladder cancer usually involves a combination of local and systemic treatments.  
> If a cystectomy is performed, additional surgery may be needed to create a new bladder.  
> You may be receiving more than one type of cancer treatment at a time.  Depending on your specific circumstances, you may alternate between chemotherapy and radiation treatment before or after surgery.  
> Chemotherapy can help stop a cancer from returning (improve the cure rate), stop it from spreading, slow its growth, or control the symptoms of a cancer that is not curable.  It can be given before or after surgery, at the same time someone is receiving radiation, or before and after radiation therapy.  It can also be combined with other forms of medication, such as immunotherapy.  
> There are many different combinations of chemotherapy medications, so the costs can vary widely from one patient to another.
> Radiation and chemotherapy are usually given in a physician clinic or hospital by specially trained medical personnel.  In some cases, you may be able to receive chemo at home with the help of specially trained nurses.  
> To get a full range of opinions and perspectives, you may want to consider input from a variety of doctors, such as your primary care physician, a medical oncologist (a doctor who specializes in the treatment of cancer), a surgeon with experience in bladder cancer, a radiation oncologist (a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy), and a urologist.

The lungs are the main part of the respiratory system, which helps us breathe.  The respiratory system is made up of several parts that allow the body to take in oxygen (inhaling) and eliminate carbon dioxide (exhaling).  When you inhale, air goes through your mouth or nose down your trachea (also called the windpipe) and into your lungs.  Once in your lungs, the air goes into smaller tubes called bronchi, which are a common place for lung cancer to start.  Lung cancer can be non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer.  
> Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer.  The 3 types of NSCLC are adenocarcinomas, which are typically in the outer parts of the lung; squamous cell carcinomas, which are typically found in the middle parts of the lung; and large cell carcinomas, which can be found anywhere in the lung and are more dangerous than the other two types.
> Small cell lung cancer is a fast growing cancer that spreads quickly to other parts of the body.  The 2 types of small cell lung cancer are small cell carcinoma, also called oat cell cancer, and combined small cell carcinoma.  

Lung Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the lung cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called “staging.”  In advanced cases lung cancer can involve the bones, lung, liver, brain and other organs and tissues.
> Metastatic lung cancer is cancer that started in the lung and has spread to other organs and tissues.  
To decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific lung cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  
> How large is the primary cancer in the lung?
> Has the cancer spread to the nearby lymph glands or anywhere else in the body?
> What are the specific genetics of the tumor?

Lung Cancer Non-Surgical Treatments
Radiation therapy involves the use of various forms of radiation, or high-energy x-ray beams, to kill cancer cells in a specific area of the body.  It can be used to cure a cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or as an alternative to surgery.  It can also be used to decrease symptoms that are related to a tumor.  Radiation can also be given before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery to prevent cancer from returning.  It may also be used to simply relieve symptoms of a progressive cancer.  It can be given simultaneously with chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy can be given in various ways, depending on what type of cancer you have and where it is located in your body.  
> Radiation therapy to treat lung cancers can be given externally by a machine that is located outside the body.  The machine sends high energy x-ray beams to the tumor.  These beams can kill the cancer cells and result in a tumor that shrinks or even disappears.  These x-ray beams must pass through normal tissue on their way to the cancer and out of the body.  The radiation that passes through these normal organs can cause damage.  Radiation oncologists plan the treatments to minimize the amount of radiation exposure to normal organs.  The treatments must be given daily over several weeks because normal tissues don’t tolerate a large dosage given at one time. 
> Three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation uses a beam that goes straight through the body.  The patient’s position is changed so this beam comes through from two or three different angles.  The approach is planned to allow the maximum exposure of radiation to the tumor.
> Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses hundreds of angles to accomplish the same task.  It is far more expensive and is used when many angles are necessary.  This approach helps to spare an important organ that is not affected by the cancer.  In IMRT the intensity of the beam is varied to conform to the shape of the tumor. The aim is to limit damage to surrounding healthy tissues, while effectively treating the cancer.  IMRT is a valuable technique for treating a small percentage of cancerous tumors, but adds little value in the treatment of others.  IMRT may not be covered by your health plan unless certain criteria are met.  
> The decision to administer radiation therapy will depend on the individual circumstances.","There are many risk factors that increase your chance of lung cancer.  Some of these risks factors can be controlled, but some cannot. You have an increased chance of developing lung cancer if you are a smoker or are exposed to secondhand smoke on a regular basis.  The longer you smoke and the more you smoke, the greater the risk.  Although cigarette smoking is the main cause of lung cancer, people who have never smoked or been exposed to secondhand smoke can develop lung cancer.  However, small cell lung cancer is very uncommon in people who have never smoked. 

Other risk factors include:
> Increased age – lung cancer is uncommon if you are younger than 45 years of age. 
> Family history – a family member has had lung cancer.
> Radiation therapy – you underwent radiation treatment. 
> Radon exposure – you were exposed to radon gas.  
> Exposure – you were exposed to asbestos, certain chemicals (paints, formaldehyde, uranium, beryllium etc.), excess air pollution, or high levels of arsenic in drinking water.  

There may be no symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer.  Some of the symptoms that can develop as the cancer grows include:
> chest pain and difficulty breathing
> persistent cough and blood in your sputum
> being unusually tired and weak
> unexplained weight loss and loss of appetite
> wheezing
As the cancer advances other symptoms can develop, such as bone and joint pain, changes in voice, difficulty swallowing, and swelling of the face or other facial symptoms.  

Contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms, which can be caused by other medical conditions that are not as serious as lung cancer.  Your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam and may order a chest x-ray, lung CT scan, or biopsy.  Other tests that may be ordered include:
> labwork
> bone scan
> MRI
> PET scan
> sputum analysis
> thoracentesis (using a needle to remove fluid from around the lungs)

The treatment for lung cancer is based on many factors that include your age and general health, the type of cancer (NSCLC or small cell lung cancer), the size of the tumor, how fast it is growing, and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.  As noted above, the specific genetics of the tumor can be very important in determining treatment.  The treatments are either local (only affects the area of the cancer) or systemic (affects all areas of the body).  Some of the local treatments include surgery to remove the cancer and radiation therapy to kill the cancer.  The systemic treatments for lung cancer are chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells and targeted therapy, which targets the changes inside cells that make them cancerous.  Treatment for lung cancer can involve a combination of local and systemic treatments.  
> Targeted therapy has been approved for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.    
> You may be receiving more than one type of cancer treatment at a time.  Depending on your specific circumstances, you may alternate between chemotherapy and radiation treatment before or after surgery.  
> Chemotherapy can help stop a cancer from returning (improve the cure rate), stop it from spreading, slow its growth, or control the symptoms of a cancer that is not curable.  It can be given before or after surgery, at the same time someone is receiving radiation, or before and after radiation therapy.  
> There are many different combinations of chemotherapy medications, so the costs can vary widely from one patient to another.
> Radiation and chemotherapy are usually given in a physician clinic or hospital by specially trained medical personnel.  In some cases, you may be able to receive chemo at home with the help of specially trained nurses.  
> To get a full range of opinions and perspectives, you may want to consider input from a variety of doctors, such as your primary care physician, a medical oncologist (a doctor who specializes in the treatment of cancer), a surgeon with experience in lung cancer, a pulmonologist (a doctor who specializes in the treatment of lung disorders), and a radiation oncologist (a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy).

It is important to remember that the total cost of this care path does not include all possible medications, labwork, or imaging studies; those charges can add up.  If your healthcare provider recommends any labwork or imaging studies you may need to search for their costs separately.","Radiation therapy is carefully directed at a tumor, but it can damage and kill normal cells as well as cancer cells.  The side effects of radiation will depend on the radiation type, dose, frequency, and area of the body being treated.  Radiation given externally can lead to the following symptoms.  
> Changes in the skin where the radiation is directed (redness, thinning, or shedding) that looks like a bad sunburn.  Radiation oncologists prescribe creams to help with the healing process.
> Loss of hair (only if treatment is being given to the head).
> Fatigue, which usually gets progressively worse toward the end of treatment and resolves over the next 4-6 weeks. 
> Radiation can cause damage to normal organs.  The planning process for radiation therapy carefully creates a plan to help avoid this exposure as much as possible.  Normal organs can tolerate some radiation exposure without any long-term problems. A radiation plan is carefully created to avoid unnecessary exposure.

You may need other types of treatment for your lung cancer.  All of the treatments for lung cancer can have side effects that may affect your recovery.  It is important to remember that treatment is usually prescribed when it is felt that the benefits will significantly outweigh the risks.
> Surgery to remove the cancer can result in infection, breathing problems, bleeding, heart attack, or stroke.  
> Chemotherapy can result in severe nausea and vomiting, increased risk of infection (impaired immune function), and loss of hair, and other side effects.  Targeted therapy usually has a different range of side effects from traditional chemotherapy, but common effects are fatigue, diarrhea, skin rashes, and nausea.
The prognosis for people with lung cancer depends on the type of cancer (NSCLC or small cell lung cancer) and whether or not it has spread to other tissue.  Treatments for lung cancer have cured some people and, for others, have decreased the symptoms related to the cancer.  This may allow them to can live longer after diagnosis and have a better quality of life.
  
There are many support groups to help cancer survivors and their families; some of these groups are attended online or by phone.  Attending these groups can allow you to meet with others who are going through the same things you are, so you don’t feel so alone.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of lung cancer or want to discuss programs that can help you quit smoking.

The test can also be done to examine the sperm and possibly determine the cause of a man’s infertility.  Your healthcare provider may recommend an ultrasound and biopsy of your testicles if you are having problems with infertility or have a lump on one of your testicles.  There are two different ways to do a testicle biopsy; your healthcare provider will determine which method is best for you.  Depending on the circumstances, a biopsy of the testicle can be done in a healthcare provider’s office or operating room.  
> Needle biopsy – The surgeon removes a small piece of testicle tissue through a small needle inserted into the testicle.  A medication is injected into the area to numb it prior to the biopsy.  A needle biopsy produces a very small hole in the skin of the scrotum, so there is less chance of infection or scarring.  However, the results may not be as accurate because it is possible to miss cancerous cells.  This type of biopsy is usually done in a healthcare provider’s office.   
> Incisional or open biopsy – The surgeon makes an incision in the scrotum and removes a piece of tissue from a testicle.  A medication is injected into the area to numb it prior to the biopsy.  Sutures are usually needed to close the incision.  An incisional biopsy is done through a small cut made in the skin, so there is a greater chance of infection or scarring.  However, the results are typically more accurate because there is a reduced chance the surgeon will miss cancerous cells. This type of biopsy is usually done in an operating room at a surgical center or hospital.  In some cases it can be done in an office.  
The costs for this care path are for an open biopsy, performed in an outpatient facility.

> Abnormal testes development – men who have a history of abnormal testes development or undescended testes.
> Medical history – men who have a previous history of testicular cancer.
> Family history – men who have a family history of testicular cancer.
> Chemical exposure – men who have a history of exposure to certain chemicals.  
> Klinefelter syndrome – men who have a history of Klinefelter syndrome, a disorder where they have an extra X chromosome.

> HIV Infection – men who have HIV may have an increased risk of developing testicular cancer.  
There is no conclusive link between having a vasectomy and developing testicular cancer.  

There may be no symptoms in the early stages of testicular cancer.  Some of the symptoms that can develop include:
> pain, discomfort, or heaviness in the testicles or scrotum
> lower back or abdominal pain
> testicle that has become larger, has a lump, or feels different than usual
> enlarged breasts (this can occur in teenage boys who do not have testicular cancer)
As the cancer advances, symptoms related to the lungs, abdomen, pelvis, back, and brain can develop.  Contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms of testicular cancer.  Your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam of your testicles, which may include shining a flashlight through your scrotum.  A biopsy is needed to determine if any abnormal findings are related to cancer.  In some cases, blood tests, x-rays, ultrasounds, and CT scan may be ordered to see if the cancer has spread to other organs.  

If your healthcare provider recommends a testicle biopsy, prior to the procedure tell them about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  You should also ask about specific instructions you should follow before and after the procedure.  These include:
> medications you should not take before or after the procedure, such as blood thinners 
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the procedure
There should not be a lot of pain during the actual biopsy, but sometimes the numbing medication can burn when it is injected into the scrotum. ","In most cases, a testicle biopsy is safe.  There are rarely serious complications, but you should be aware of the risks and talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have.  Some of the potential risks are:
> infection
> a swollen or discolored scrotum
Let your healthcare provider know if you have any signs of infection (fever, excessive pain, or colored discharge), significant bleeding, or the swelling and discoloration do not resolve within a few days.  Your healthcare provider may recommend an athletic support and avoidance of sexual activity for a brief period after the procedure.

The testicles are two glands that are part of the male reproductive system.  They are located in the scrotum, a sack that sits behind the penis, and their primary function is to produce sperm and testosterone (a male hormone).  The two primary types of testicular cancer (seminoma and nonseminoma) start in the cells in the testicles that make sperm.  
> Seminomas usually do not grow very fast and are usually only found in the testicles.  However, in some cases they can spread to the lymph nodes near the testicles.  This type of cancer is very sensitive to radiation and is often found in men in their 30 to 40s, but can occur in younger or older men as well.
> Nonseminoma testicular cancer is made up of different cells and tends to grow faster than seminoma cancer.  Nonseminomas are more common than seminomas and often occur in young men.  

Testicular Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the testicular cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called “staging.”  In advanced cases, testicular cancer can spread to other organs in the abdomen, lungs, and spine.
> Metastatic testicular cancer is cancer that started in the testicles and has spread to other organs and tissues.  
To decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific testicular cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Does the cancer invade outside the testicles?
> How large is the primary cancer in the testicle?
> Has the cancer spread to lymph glands or anywhere else in the body?

Testicular Cancer Surgical Treatments
An orchiectomy, the removal of one or both of the testicles through an incision in the groin, is the primary surgical treatment for testicular cancer.  The nearby lymph nodes may also be removed at the same time as the testicle(s).  
> Removal of the testicles is done for both seminomas and nonseminomas.
> If only one testicle is removed, there should be minimal impact to your sex drive and you will still be able to father children if the other testicle is healthy.
> If both testicles are removed, you may need to take a testosterone supplement and you will not be able to father children.

Testicular Cancer Non-Surgical Treatments
Radiation therapy involves the use of various forms of radiation, or high-energy x-ray beams, to kill cancer cells in a specific area of the body.  It can be used to cure a cancer that cannot be removed by surgery, as an alternative to surgery, or to decrease symptoms that are related to a tumor.  Radiation can also be given before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery to prevent cancer from returning or to simply relieve symptoms of a progressive cancer.  It can be given simultaneously with chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy can be given in various ways, depending on what type of cancer you have and where it is located in your body.  
> Radiation therapy, which is only recommended for seminoma testicular cancer, is usually given externally by a machine that is located outside the body.  The machine sends high energy x-ray beams to the tumor, which can kill the cancer cells and result in a tumor that shrinks or even disappears.  These x-ray beams must pass through normal tissue on their way to the cancer and on their way out of the body.  The radiation that passes through these normal organs can cause damage.  Radiation oncologists plan the treatments to minimize the amount of radiation exposure to normal organs.  The treatments must be given daily over several weeks because normal tissues don’t tolerate a large dosage given at one time. 
> Three dimensional (3D) conformal radiation uses a beam that goes straight through the body.  The patient’s position is changed so that this beam comes through from two or three different angles.  The approach is planned to allow the maximum exposure of radiation to the tumor.
> Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses hundreds of angles to accomplish the same task.  It is far more expensive and is only necessary when many angles are necessary to spare an important organ that is not affected by the cancer.  In IMRT the intensity of the beam is varied to conform to the shape of the tumor and the testicle. The aim is to limit damage to surrounding healthy tissues, while effectively treating the cancer.  IMRT is a valuable technique for treating a small percentage of cancerous tumors, but adds little value in the treatment of others.  Therefore, IMRT may not be covered by your health plan unless certain criteria are met.  
> Brachytherapy applies the radiation source internally immediately next to the area being treated.","It is not known what causes testicular cancer.  Some of the factors that may increase a man’s risk of developing testicular cancer are noted below.
> Age – men who are between the ages of 15 and 34. 
> Abnormal testes development – men who have a history of abnormal testes development or undescended testes.
> Medical history – men who have a previous history of testicular cancer.
> Family history – men who have a family history of testicular cancer.
> Chemical exposure – men who have a history of exposure to certain chemicals.  
> Klinefelter syndrome – men who have a history of Klinefelter syndrome, a disorder where they have an extra X chromosome.
> Race – Caucasian men have a higher risk than African-American or Asian-American men. 
> HIV Infection – men who have HIV may have an increased risk of developing testicular cancer.  
There is no conclusive link between having a vasectomy and developing testicular cancer.  

There may be no symptoms in the early stages of testicular cancer.  Some of the symptoms that can develop include:
> pain, discomfort, or heaviness in the testicles or scrotum
> lower back or abdominal pain
> testicle that has become larger, has a lump, or feels different than usual
> enlarged breast tissue (this can occur in teenage boys who do not have testicular cancer)
As the cancer advances, symptoms related to the lungs, abdomen, pelvis, back, and brain can develop.  Contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms of testicular cancer.  Your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam of your testicles, which may include shining a flashlight through your scrotum.  A biopsy is needed to determine if any abnormal findings are related to cancer.  In some cases, blood tests, x-rays, ultrasounds, and CT scan may be ordered to see if the cancer has spread to other organs.

The treatment for testicular cancer is based on many factors that include your age and general health, the size and grade of the tumor, how fast it is growing, and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.  The treatments are either local (only affects the area of the cancer) or systemic (affects all areas of the body).  Some of the local treatments include surgery to remove the cancer and radiation to kill the cancer cells.  The systemic treatment for testicular cancer is chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells.  Treatment for testicular cancer often involves a combination of local and systemic treatments. 
> You may be receiving more than one type of cancer treatment at a time.  Depending on your circumstances, you may alternate between chemotherapy and radiation treatment before or after surgery.  
> Chemotherapy can help stop a cancer from returning (improve the cure rate), stop it from spreading, slow its growth, or control the symptoms of a cancer that is not curable.  It can be given before or after surgery, at the same time someone is receiving radiation, or before and after radiation therapy.   
> There are many different combinations of chemotherapy medications, so the costs can vary widely from one patient to another.
> Radiation and chemotherapy are usually given in a physician clinic or hospital by specially trained medical personnel.  In some cases, you may be able to receive chemo at home with the help of specially trained nurses.  
> To get a full range of opinions and perspectives, you may want to consider input from a variety of doctors, such as your primary care physician, a medical oncologist (a doctor who specializes in the treatment of cancer), a urologist or surgeon with experience in testicular cancer, and a radiation oncologist (a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy).

It is important to remember that the total cost of this care path does not include all possible medications, labwork, or imaging studies; those charges can add up.  If your healthcare provider recommends any labwork or imaging studies you may need to search for their costs separately.","Radiation therapy is carefully directed at a tumor, but it can damage and kill normal cells as well as cancer cells.  The side effects of radiation will depend on the radiation type, dose, frequency, and area of the body being treated.  Radiation that is given externally can lead to the following symptoms.  
> Changes in the skin where the radiation is directed (redness, thinning, or shedding) that looks like a bad sunburn.  Radiation oncologists prescribe creams to help with the healing process.
> Loss of hair (only if treatment is being given to the head).
> Fatigue, which usually gets progressively worse towards the end of treatment and then resolves over the next 4-6 weeks. 
> Radiation can cause damage to normal organs.  The planning process for radiation therapy carefully creates a plan to help avoid this exposure as much as possible.  Normal organs can tolerate some radiation exposure without any long-term problems. A radiation plan is carefully created to avoid unnecessary exposure.

You may need other types of treatment for your testicular cancer.  All of the treatments for testicular cancer can have side effects that may affect your recovery.  It is important to remember that treatment is usually prescribed when it is felt that the benefits will significantly outweigh the risks. 
> Chemotherapy can result in severe nausea and vomiting, increased risk of infection (impaired immune function), and loss of hair, and other side effects.  
> Radiation therapy, which is typically only used to treat seminomas, can result in burns, fatigue, and a temporary decrease in sperm production.  

The prognosis for men with testicular cancer depends on the stage of the disease at diagnosis and whether or not it has spread to surrounding tissue.  In general, there is a very good chance of cure, especially if the cancer has not spread beyond the testicles.  
> Cancer of the testicles is considered one of most treatable cancers.  

There are many support groups to help testicular cancer survivors and their families; some of these groups are attended online or by phone.  Attending these groups can allow you to meet with others who are going through the same things you are and may help, so you don’t feel so alone.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of testicular cancer.

The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that are located on either side toward the back, just below the rib cage.  One of the main functions of the kidneys is to filter the blood and make urine, a process that removes waste and extra water.  The urine flows down two tubes (ureters) to the bladder, where it is stored until it leaves the body when you urinate.  The kidneys also help control blood pressure, the level of electrolytes in your blood, the production of certain hormones, and the production of red blood cells. 
> The most common type of kidney cancer is renal cell carcinoma, which starts in the tubules used to transport liquid that are located inside the kidney.

Kidney Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for whether the kidney cancer has spread to other areas of the body.  This process is called “staging.”  Kidney cancer can spread to the lungs and other organs and tissues in the body.
> Metastatic kidney cancer is cancer that started in the kidney and has spread to other organs and tissues.  
To decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is right in your your situation, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Does the kidney cancer invade tissues outside the kidney?
> How large is the primary cancer in the kidney?  Are both kidneys involved?
> Has the cancer spread to pelvic lymph nodes or anywhere else in the body?

Kidney Cancer Surgical Treatments
There are two different ways to remove a kidney (also known as a nephrectomy). One is through a large incision on the side of the abdomen and the other is through several smaller incisions (laparoscopic).  The surgery your healthcare provider recommends will depend on your specific circumstances, including stage of cancer and your personal preferences. 
> A total removal of the kidney (nephrectomy) is the most common treatment for kidney cancer.  > If necessary, the lymph nodes and other parts of the urinary symptom may also be removed.   
> If both kidneys are removed, or the other kidney is not functioning, kidney replacement therapy will be needed.  This would either be through dialysis or a transplant.  Often, dialysis is necessary until a transplant can be done.","It is not known what causes kidney cancer, but there are several factors that may increase your risk.

The treatment for kidney cancer is based on many factors that include your age, your general health, your symptoms, and the type and stage of the cancer.  However, the primary treatment is removal of the diseased kidney and surrounding organs.  
> Although some hormone treatments can help shrink a kidney tumor, in general radiation and chemotherapy have not been effective treatments for kidney cancer.  
> Targeted or biologic therapy interferes with the changes in cells that help sustain cancer.  In recent years they have been increasingly used in patients with advanced disease, with some excellent results.
> To get a full range of opinions and perspectives, you may want to consider input from a variety of doctors, such as your primary care physician, a medical oncologist (a doctor who specializes in the treatment of cancer), a surgeon with experience in kidney cancer, a radiation oncologist (a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy), and a urologist.

If your healthcare provider recommends a nephrectomy, prior to the surgery tell them about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  You should also ask about specific instructions to follow before and after the surgery.  These include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery from surgical procedures.
During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia is the most common type of anesthesia for a nephrectomy. With this type of anesthesia, you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
After your surgery, you may need pain medication and help at home while you recover.

","Although it is a major surgery, in most cases a nephrectomy is safe.  However, the outcome can depend on age, lifestyle (including smoking), reason for the nephrectomy (including stage of cancer), other treatments that may be recommended (chemotherapy, radiation), and overall physical and mental health.  There are several significant risks that you should be aware of and discuss with your healthcare provider.  
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and various infections.  
> Risks specific to this type of surgery include infection and uncontrolled blood pressure and fluid/electrolyte balance.  
> If both kidneys are removed, or the remaining kidney is not working, dialysis will be needed until a healthy kidney is transplanted.  

You may need other types of treatment for your kidney cancer.  All of the treatments for kidney cancer can have side effects that may affect your recovery.  It is important to remember that treatment is usually prescribed when it is felt that the benefits will significantly outweigh the risks.
> Chemotherapy can result in nausea and vomiting, mouth sores, increased risk of infection (impaired immune function), loss of hair, and other side effects.  Hormone and targeted therapy usually have a different range of side effects from traditional chemotherapy.
> Radiation therapy can result in burns, fatigue, and damage to the other organs.  
The prognosis for those with kidney cancer depends on the stage of the disease at diagnosis and if it has spread to surrounding tissue.  The outcome is not as good if the cancer has spread beyond the kidney into surrounding tissues, the lungs, lymph nodes, or other areas of the body.

> Cancers of the sinuses and nasal cavity.  These are hollow spaces inside the head and nose.  
> Cancer of the salivary glands.  These are the glands in the floor of the mouth that produce saliva.  Cancer of the salivary glands is uncommon.    

Head or Neck Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the head or neck cancer to the lymph nodes in the neck or other areas of the body.  This process is called “staging.”  
> Metastatic head or neck cancer is one of several cancers that started in the moist areas of the head or neck and has spread to the lymph nodes or other organs and tissues.  
To decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific head or neck cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Where is it located?
> How large is the primary cancer?
> Has the cancer spread to lymph glands or anywhere else in the body?

Head or Neck Cancer Surgical Treatment
A cervical lymphadenectomy is the removal of the lymph nodes and surrounding tissue through a large curved incision that starts at the ear and goes to the chin.  It is done to remove the lymph nodes and tissue that contain cancerous cells.  The specific surgery depends on how many lymph nodes, and how much surrounding tissue, contain cancerous cells.  The three main surgeries are a radical neck dissection, a selective neck dissection, and a modified neck dissection.
> A radical neck dissection is when the surgeon removes all the lymph nodes, tissue, muscles, nerves, salivary glands, and major blood vessel on the side of the neck where the cancer was found.  
> A selective neck dissection is when the surgeon only removes some of the lymph nodes from the side of the neck where the cancer was found.  It can be done if the cancer has not spread very far and may spare the nerves, blood vessels, muscle.
> A modified radical neck dissection is when the surgeon removes the lymph nodes and some surrounding tissue on the side of the neck where the cancer was found.  The nerves, blood vessels, and muscle may be spared with this type of surgery.  
The costs for this care path are for a modified neck dissection, which is the most common surgery.","Head or neck cancers are a group of cancers that typically start in the moist membranes of the head and neck, such as the mouth, nose, throat, and salivary glands (uncommon).  They can develop at any age, but are more common in men over 50 years of age.  The risk factors for cancers of the head and neck include:
> tobacco and alcohol use (cause about 75% of cancers of the head or neck)
> history of certain viruses, such as Human Papillomavirus (HPV) or Epstein-Barr (EB) infection
> prior radiation therapy to the head or neck area 
> use of betel quid (a type of chewing tobacco) or mate (a type of tea)
> poor oral health
> exposure to certain particles or chemicals in the workplace (wood dust, asbestos)
> Asian ancestry
The primary ways to prevent cancers of the head and neck are by not using tobacco and limiting alcohol intake.  Also, being aware of your risk factors can improve your prognosis by leading to early diagnosis and treatment.

The symptoms of head and throat cancers vary depending on the location of the cancer.  These symptoms can be similar to those of other less serious conditions, so medical evaluation is necessary.  Some of the symptoms include:
> a sore or lump that does not heal
> a constant sore throat
> frequent headaches
> swallowing and eating difficulty
> changes or hoarseness in voice
> pain when speaking or swallowing
> pain in the ears or teeth
> chronic sinus infections that do not respond to treatment
> swelling of the jawline or under the chin
Contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms.  He or she will review your symptoms and perform a physical examination.  They may also recommend one of the following tests: 
> a laryngoscopy, an examination of your mouth and throat using a special instrument
> removal of abnormal tissue for examination under a microscope (biopsy)
A biopsy is needed to determine if an abnormality is cancer.  If your biopsy indicates you do have cancer, additional testing may be needed.

Treatments for head or neck cancer are either local (only affects the area of the cancer) or systemic (affects all areas of the body).  Some of the local treatments include surgery to remove the cancer and radiation (external) to kill the cancer.  The systemic treatments for head or neck cancer include chemotherapy and targeted therapy, which targets the changes inside cells that make them cancerous.  The goal of all treatments is to target and kill cancer cells.    
> Treatment may involve a combination of local and systemic treatments, especially if the cancer has gone to other parts of your body.  
> Chemotherapy can help stop a cancer from returning (improve the cure rate), stop it from spreading, slow its growth, or control the symptoms of a cancer that is not curable.  It can be given before or after surgery, at the same time someone is receiving radiation, or before and after radiation therapy.  
> There are many different combinations of chemotherapy medications, so the costs can vary widely from one patient to another.
> You may be receiving more than one type of cancer treatment at a time.  Depending on your specific circumstances, you may alternate between chemotherapy and radiation treatment before or after surgery. 
 > Radiation and chemotherapy are usually given in a clinic or hospital by specially trained medical personnel.  In some cases, you may be able to receive chemo at home with the help of specially trained nurses.  
> To get a full range of opinions and perspectives, you may want to consider input from a variety of doctors, such as your primary care physician, a medical oncologist (a doctor who specializes in the treatment of cancer), a surgeon with experience in head or neck cancer, a radiation oncologist (a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy), and a plastic surgeon.

If your healthcare provider recommends a neck dissection, prior to the surgery tell them about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  You should also ask about specific instructions to follow before and after the surgery.  These include:
> medications you may need to take before the surgery
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery from surgical procedures
During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia is the most common type of anesthesia for this surgery. With this type of anesthesia, you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
Recovery typically takes months and can involve speech therapy, swallowing evaluations, and other follow up care.  You may need pain medication and help at home while you recover.  

It is important to remember that the total cost of this care path does not include all possible medications, lab work, or imaging studies; those charges can add up.  If your healthcare provider recommends any lab work or imaging studies, you may need to search for their costs separately.
","All the neck dissections are major surgery and have many serious risks.  The risks are less if before surgery you are physically active, younger than 65 years of age, a non-smoker, and have a healthy weight (are not underweight or overweight).  You should be aware of the risks and talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have.  
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, heart problems, stroke, and various infections.  
> Risks specific to this type of surgery include numbness on the side of the surgery that may not go away; nerve damage; problems with the neck and arm on the side of the surgery; and difficulty with talking, swallowing, and eating

You may need other types of treatment for your cancer.  All of the treatments for cancer can have different side effects that may affect your recovery.  It is important to remember that treatment is usually prescribed when it is felt that the benefits will significantly outweigh the risks.
> Chemotherapy can result in nausea and vomiting, increased risk of infection (impaired immune function), loss of hair, and other side effects.  Targeted therapy often has a different range of side effects from traditional chemotherapy.
> External radiation therapy can result in burns and skin texture changes, fatigue, mouth pain and sores, a decrease in saliva that causes a dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, problems tasting food, nausea, and swelling or sagging of the skin around the jaw.  You also may not be able to open your mouth very far due to stiffness of your jaw.      

The prognosis for people with head or neck cancer depends on the type of cancer and where the tumor is located. It also depends on whether or not it has spread to surrounding tissue, the size of the tumor, and how fast the tumor is growing.  Your age, lifestyle (including smoking), other recommended treatments, and your overall physical and mental health can affect your outcome.

There are many support groups to help cancer survivors and their families; some of these groups are attended online or by phone.  Attending these groups can allow you to meet with others who are going through the same things you are, so you don’t feel so alone.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of head or neck cancer.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you’ve had them. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms to report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects or precautions).
> If your healthcare provider wants you to take a medication, ask if an over-the-counter product is right for you.
> If your healthcare provider prescribes a medication for you, ask for a generic version. If your doctor thinks that a generic version is not right for you, ask for a medication on the lowest available tier of your Prescription Drug List (PDL).

What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a removal of the lymph nodes in my neck?
> Are there any alternatives to surgery?  Why are you choosing one surgery over another?
> Do I need to fast before the surgery and, if so, for how long?  Is there any other special preparation for the surgery?  (If so, get clear instructions on what you need to do.)  What kind of sedation will I have? What are the possible side effects?
> What are the possible complications, how will I feel after the surgery, and how will I have to modify your activity?  Don’t forget to make arrangements for help at home.
> What type of follow-up will I need?  Will I need therapy (speech and/or physical therapy) or swallowing evaluations?  
> Will I need to see a dietician?  Will I be able to eat and breathe normally?  
Make a list of your questions/concerns/symptoms and medications (including over-the-counter).  Verify which medications you should take before the surgery.

Head or Neck Cancer Non-Surgical Treatment
Radiation therapy involves the use of various forms of radiation, or high-energy x-ray beams, to kill cancer cells in a specific area of the body.  It can be used to cure a cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or as an alternative to surgery.  It can also be used to decrease symptoms that are related to a tumor.  Radiation can also be given before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery to prevent cancer from returning.  It may also be used to simply relieve symptoms of a progressive cancer.  It can be given simultaneously with chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy can be given in various ways, depending on what type of cancer you have and where it is located in your body.  
> Radiation therapy to treat various head or neck cancers is usually given externally by a machine that is located outside the body.  The machine sends high energy x-ray beams to the tumor, which can kill the cancer cells and result in a tumor that shrinks or even disappears.  These x-ray beams must pass through normal tissue on their way to the cancer and on their way out of the body.  The radiation that passes through these normal organs can cause damage.  Radiation oncologists plan the treatments to minimize the amount of radiation exposure to normal organs.  The treatments must be given daily over several weeks because normal tissues don’t tolerate a large dosage given at one time. 
> Radiation today is given externally using three types of technology.  Three dimensional (3D) conformal radiation uses a beam that goes straight through the body.  The patient’s position is changed so that this beam comes through from two or three different angles.  The approach is planned to allow the maximum exposure of radiation to the tumor.
> Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses hundreds of angles to accomplish the same task.  It is far more expensive and is only necessary when many angles are necessary to spare an important organ that is not affected by the cancer.  In IMRT the intensity of the beam is varied to conform to the shape of the tumor. The aim is to limit damage to surrounding healthy tissues, while effectively treating the cancer.  IMRT is a valuable technique for treating a small percentage of cancerous tumors, but adds little value in the treatment of others.  Therefore, IMRT may not be covered by your health plan unless certain criteria are met.

","Radiation therapy is carefully directed at a tumor, but it can damage and kill normal cells as well as cancer cells.  The side effects of radiation will depend on the radiation type, dose, frequency, and area of the body being treated.  Radiation that is given externally can lead to the following symptoms.  
> Changes in the skin where the radiation is directed (redness, thinning, or shedding) that looks like a bad sunburn.  Radiation oncologists prescribe creams to help with the healing process.
> Mouth pain and sores, a decrease in saliva that causes a dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, problems tasting food, nausea, and swelling or sagging of the skin around the jaw.  You also may not be able to open your mouth very far due to stiffness of your jaw.
> Loss of hair (only if treatment is being given to the head).
> Fatigue, which usually gets progressively worse towards the end of treatment and then resolves over the next 4-6 weeks. 
> Radiation can cause damage to normal organs.  The planning process for radiation therapy carefully creates a plan to help avoid this exposure as much as possible.  Normal organs can tolerate some radiation exposure without any long-term problems. A radiation plan is carefully created to avoid unnecessary exposure.

Eating a diet that is vegetarian, or a diet that is low in fat and high in omega-3 fatty acids, can help decrease your risk of developing prostate cancer.  Discuss the pros and cons of having digital rectal exams (DRE) and PSA testing with your healthcare provider.

There may be no symptoms in the early stages of prostate cancer.  Some of the symptoms, which can also be due to other non-cancerous prostate problems, include:
> difficulty starting urination or a urine flow that is slower than normal
> leaking of urine, especially after urinating
> having to strain to push urine out or difficulty emptying the bladder
> bloody urine or semen

The prostate gland is part of the male reproductive system; it produces the fluid that carries sperm and provides them with nutrition.  It is a small gland, about the size of a walnut, and is located just below the bladder next to the rectum.  The prostate gland surrounds the tube that carries urine from the bladder (urethra), so when it enlarges it can affect a man’s ability to urinate normally.  
> The prostate gland frequently becomes enlarged in men as they grow older.  This enlargement is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  A prostate biopsy is needed to determine if enlargement is due to cancer or BPH.   
> BPH does not increase a man’s risk for prostate cancer.  
> A blood test that can be used to monitor the prostate gland is called prostate specific antigen, or PSA.  Although it may be used to screen for prostate cancer, PSA levels can be elevated for reasons other than prostate cancer (such as BPH, recent manipulation of the prostate, infection or sexual intercourse).   

Prostate Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the prostate cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called “staging.”  In advanced cases prostate cancer can involve the bones and other organs.
> Metastatic prostate cancer is cancer that started in the prostate and has spread to other organs and tissues.  
> In early cases of prostate cancer it is usually not necessary to do additional imaging studies to check for other cancers because spread is quite rare.  
To decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific prostate cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Does the prostate cancer invade tissues and organs outside the prostate gland?
> How large is the primary cancer in the prostate?
> Has the cancer spread to lymph glands or anywhere else in the body?

Prostate Cancer Surgical Treatments
A prostatectomy is the removal of the prostate gland and surrounding tissue, through a single large incision or several small incisions in the abdomen.  It is usually done when cancer is only found in the prostate gland and has not spread to other areas of the body.  There are 4 different ways the prostate gland can be removed.  Which type of prostatectomy your healthcare provider recommends will depend on your individual circumstances.  
> Radical retropubic prostatectomy is when the prostate is removed through a long incision that goes from the belly button to the pubic bone, just above the pubic hair line.  
> Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is when the prostate is removed using small instruments and a camera that are inserted through several small incisions in the abdomen.  
> Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy is when the prostate is removed by robotic arms that are controlled by a surgeon using a computer.  The robotic arms use small instruments and a camera that are inserted through several small incisions in the abdomen.  
> Radical perineal prostatectomy is when the prostate is removed through a small incision made between the anus and the scrotum.  There is less blood loss with this type of surgery, but there is greater risk of damage to the nerves in the area.  
After the surgery a catheter will be placed into the penis to drain urine from the bladder.  A drain may also be placed near the incision to drain excess fluid from the area.","There are many risk factors that increase a man’s chance of prostate cancer.  Some of these risks factors can be controlled, but some cannot.
> Age – you are over 60.
> Family history – your father or brother has a history of prostate cancer.
> Race – you are African-American. 
> Alcohol use – you drink an excessive amount of alcohol.
> Agent Orange and cadmium – you were exposed to Agent Orange or cadmium.  
> Diet – your diet is high in fat, especially animal fat.
> Occupation – you are a farmer, tire plant worker, or painter.
Eating a diet that is vegetarian, or a diet that is low in fat and high in omega-3 fatty acids, can help decrease your risk of developing prostate cancer.  Discuss the pros and cons of having digital rectal exams (DRE) and PSA testing with your healthcare provider.

There may be no symptoms in the early stages of prostate cancer.  Some of the symptoms, which can also be due to other non-cancerous prostate problems, include:
> difficulty starting urination or a urine flow that is slower than normal
> leaking of urine, especially after urinating
> having to strain to push urine out or difficulty emptying the bladder
> bloody urine or semen
As the cancer advances, pain in the bones, typically the lower back and hip area can develop.  You should contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms of prostate cancer.  Your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam of your prostate (digital rectal exam) and may order a PSA level or biopsy.  In some cases, a bone scan and CT scan may be ordered to see if the cancer has spread to other organs.  
> Prostate cancer is often a very slow-growing cancer.  Very small prostate cancers may not cause any problems, yet the treatments for prostate cancer (such as surgery or radiation) can have significant unwanted side effects.

The treatment for prostate cancer is based on many factors that include your age and general health, the size and grade of the tumor, how fast it is growing, and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.  The treatments are either local (only affects the area of the cancer) or systemic (affects all areas of the body).  Some of the local treatments include surgery to remove the cancer and radiation to kill the cancer cells.  Some of the systemic treatments for prostate cancer are chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells, hormone therapy to block the effect of hormones that increase cancer growth, and targeted or biologic therapy to interfere with the changes in cells that help sustain the cancer.  Treatment for prostate cancer usually involves a combination of local and systemic treatments. 
> Depending on your circumstances, you may receive a combination of treatment approaches that include the local and systemic ones mentioned above.  
> With prostate cancer, chemotherapy is usually give to control the growth and symptoms of cancer that is not curable.  It is often given after hormonal therapy. 
> Chemotherapy can help stop a cancer from returning, stop it from spreading, slow its growth, or control the symptoms of a cancer that is not curable.  It can be given before or after surgery, at the same time someone is receiving radiation, or before and after radiation therapy.  It can also be combined with other forms of medication, such as hormone therapy.  
> There are many different chemotherapy medications, so the costs can vary widely from one patient to another.
> Radiation and chemotherapy are usually given in a physician clinic or hospital by specially trained medical personnel.  
> Targeted therapy has been approved for some cases of prostate cancer.    
> To get a full range of opinions and perspectives, you may want to consider input from a variety of doctors, such as your primary care physician, a medical oncologist (a doctor who specializes in the treatment of cancer), a urologist or surgeon with experience in prostate cancer, and a radiation oncologist (a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy).

Since prostate cancer often grows slowly, experts may not agree on whether early detection and treatment will prolong life.  As an alternative, prostate cancer treatment can also involve “watchful waiting” or “active surveillance.”  
> Watchful waiting means a decision has been made to treat cancer symptoms, if present, but not the cancer. This is an option for elderly men with a short life expectancy or men with complex medical conditions.  A decision to treat the cancer may be made if it causes significant symptoms or appears to be acting more aggressively.  
> Active surveillance means a decision has been made to monitor the growth or spread of the cancer through digital rectal exams (DRE), PSA testing, and biopsy. It's indicated in younger men in good health who decide that the risks of other treatments outweigh the benefits.

If your healthcare provider recommends a prostatectomy, prior to the surgery you should tell them about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  You should also ask about specific instructions you should follow before and after the surgery.  These may include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery
> taking a laxative to clean out your bowels before the surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery from surgical procedures.
During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia is the most common type of anesthesia for a prostatectomy. With this type of anesthesia, you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
You may need pain medication and help at home while you recover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

It is important to remember that the total cost of this care path does not include all possible medications, labwork, or imaging studies; those charges can add up.  If your healthcare provider recommends any labwork or imaging studies you may need to search for their costs separately.","The risks associated with having a prostatectomy are generally the same as other major operations.  However, the outcome can depend on age, lifestyle (including smoking), reason for the prostatectomy (including staging and grade of cancer), other treatments that may be recommended (chemotherapy, radiation, hormone therapy), and overall physical and mental health.  There are several significant risks that you should be aware of and discuss with your healthcare provider.  
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and various infections.  
> Risks specific to this type of surgery include infection, nerve damage that can lead to an inability to control urine (incontinence) and problems with having an erection (impotence), injury to the rectal area, and narrowing of the urethra (where urine flows) because of scar tissue.  You should let your healthcare provider know if you have any signs of infection (fever, excessive pain, or discharge) or inability to urinate after the catheter is removed.  

You may need other types of treatment for your prostate cancer.  All of the treatments for prostate cancer can have side effects that may affect your recovery.  It is important to remember that treatment is usually prescribed when it is felt that the benefits will significantly outweigh the risks. 
> Chemotherapy can result in severe nausea and vomiting, increased risk of infection (impaired immune function), loss of hair, and other side effects.  Targeted therapy usually has a different range of side effects from traditional chemotherapy.
> Radiation therapy, especially internal radiation, can result in skin burns, fatigue, impotence (inability to achieve or maintain an erection), and inability to control urine flow (urinary incontinence).  
> Hormone therapy can have many side effects that include decreased interest in sex and difficulty with erections, hot flashes, pain in the area of the tumor, memory loss and mood changes, thinning of bones, decreased muscle mass, anemia, increased cholesterol, and increased weight.  

The prognosis for men with prostate cancer depends on the stage of the disease at diagnosis and if it has spread to surrounding tissue.  In general, there is a good chance of cure if the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland.  
> Cure is also possible if the cancer has only spread a little outside the prostate gland.  

There are many support groups to help cancer survivors and their families; some of these groups are attended online or by phone.  Attending these groups can allow you to meet with others who are going through the same things you are, so you don’t feel so alone.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of prostate cancer or want to discuss the pros and cons of prostate cancer screening.  Be prepared to discuss any symptoms you have and how long you’ve had them. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects or precautions).
> If your healthcare provider wants you to take a medication, ask if an over-the-counter product is right for you.
> If your healthcare provider prescribes a medication for you, ask for a generic version. If your doctor thinks that a generic version is not right for you, ask for a medication on the lowest available tier of your Prescription Drug List (PDL).

What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a prostatectomy?
> What is my diagnosis (specific type of prostate cancer, if present) and reason for the surgery?  Are there other less invasive options?
> Are “Watchful Waiting” or “Active Surveillance” an option for me?  
> Will I be receiving other treatments before or after my surgery?
> Do I need to fast before the surgery and, if so, for how long?  Is there any other special preparation for the surgery?  (If so, get clear instructions on what you need to do.)  What kind of sedation will I have? What are the possible side effects?
> What are the possible complications, how will I feel after the surgery, and how will I have to modify my activity.  Don’t forget to make arrangements for help at home.
Make a list of your questions/concerns/symptoms and medications (including over-the-counter). Verify which medications you should take before the surgery.  
After your surgery, you should know what you had done, what medication was given, and what symptoms you should report to your healthcare provider.

The prostate is part of the male reproductive system; it produces the fluid that carries sperm and provides them with nutrition.  It is a small gland, about the size of a walnut, and is located just below the bladder next to the rectum.  The prostate gland surrounds the tube that carries urine from the bladder (urethra), so when it enlarges it can affect a man’s ability to urinate normally.  
> The prostate gland frequently becomes enlarged in men as they grow older.  This is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  A prostate biopsy is needed to determine if enlargement is related to cancer or BPH.   
> BPH does not increase a man’s risk for prostate cancer.  
> A blood test that can be used to monitor the prostate gland is called prostate specific antigen, or PSA.  Although it may be used to screen for prostate cancer, PSA levels can be elevated for reasons other than prostate cancer (such as BPH, recent manipulation of the prostate, infection or sexual intercourse).   

Prostate Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the prostate cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called “staging.”  In advanced cases prostate cancer can involve the bones and other organs and tissues.
> Metastatic prostate cancer is cancer that started in the prostate and has spread to other organs.  
> In early cases of prostate cancer it is usually not necessary to do additional imaging studies to check for other cancers because spread is quite rare.  
To decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific prostate cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information: 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Does the prostate cancer invade outside the prostate gland?
> How large is the primary cancer in the prostate?
> Has the cancer spread to lymph glands or anywhere else in the body?

Prostate Cancer Non-Surgical Treatments
Radiation therapy involves the use of various forms of radiation, or high-energy x-ray beams, to kill cancer cells in a specific area of the body.  It can be used to cure a cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or as an alternative to surgery.  It can also be used to decrease symptoms that are related to a tumor.  Radiation can also be given before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery to prevent cancer from returning.  It may also be used to simply relieve symptoms of a progressive cancer.  It can be given simultaneously with chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy can be given in various ways, depending on what type of cancer you have and where it is located in your body.  
> Radiation therapy to treat prostate cancer can be given externally by a machine that is located outside the body.  The machine sends high energy x-ray beams to the tumor.  These beams can kill the cancer cells and result in a tumor that shrinks or even disappears.  These x-ray beams must pass through normal tissue on their way to the cancer and out of the body.  The radiation that passes through these normal organs can cause damage.  Radiation oncologists plan the treatments to minimize the amount of radiation exposure to normal organs.  The treatments must be given daily over several weeks because normal tissues don’t tolerate a large dosage given at one time. 
> Three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation uses a beam that goes straight through the body.  The patient’s position is changed so this beam comes through from two or three different angles.  The approach is planned to allow the maximum exposure of radiation to the tumor.
> Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses hundreds of angles to accomplish the same task.  It is far more expensive and is used when many angles are necessary.  This approach helps to spare an important organ that is not affected by the cancer.  In IMRT the intensity of the beam is varied to conform to the shape of the tumor. The aim is to limit damage to surrounding healthy tissues, while effectively treating the cancer.  IMRT is a valuable technique for treating a small percentage of cancerous tumors, but adds little value in the treatment of others.  IMRT may not be covered by your health plan unless certain criteria are met.  
> The decision to administer radiation therapy will depend on the individual circumstances.
> Prostate cancer is often treated by placing radioactive seeds or pellets into the prostate (brachytherapy).  This is often done when the tumor is small and grows slowly.  The seeds give out a low dose of radiation over a long period, usually several months, and are not usually removed. In some cases (high-dose radiation), the seeds are removed when the treatment is finished.","There are many risk factors that increase a man’s chance of prostate cancer.  Some of these risks factors can be controlled, but some cannot.

> Changes in the skin where the radiation is directed (redness, thinning, or shedding) that looks like a bad sunburn.  Radiation oncologists prescribe creams to help with the healing process.
> Loss of hair (only if treatment is being given to the head).
> Fatigue, which usually gets progressively worse toward the end of treatment and resolves over the next 4-6 weeks. 
> Diarrhea and painful bowel movements.
> Problems with urination.

A screening colonoscopy is done on a person who has no symptoms when he or she reaches a certain age, usually age 50.  It may be done at an earlier age in certain persons because of their family history or personal medical history.
 
A diagnostic colonoscopy can be done to check the cause of symptoms that might be due to diseases of the colon and remove any abnormal tissue for testing.  The most common biopsy of the colon involves the removal of a polyp or polyps.
> Polyps are abnormal tissue or growths that are attached to the lining of the colon.  Some colon polyps can be cancerous, others can be precancerous, while many are completely benign.   
> Polyps can be found at either a screening colonoscopy or a diagnostic colonoscopy.
> This procedure can reduce your risk of getting colon cancer by removing polyps before they become cancerous. ","Most colonoscopies are done to screen for colon cancer or for polyps that may become cancerous.  A biopsy may be needed if an abnormality is found during a screening colonoscopy.  Since any colonoscopy might lead to a biopsy, which is a minor surgical procedure, prior to the procedure you should tell your doctor about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Some medicines can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation or the exam. Your doctor will usually give you a list of medications that you should stop taking before your colonoscopy.  The day before the colonoscopy, you will be instructed to drink only clear liquids and take medicine to clean out your bowels.  Just before the test, you may be given a medicine that makes you relaxed and sleepy (a sedative) or one that puts you to sleep (anesthesia).  Sometimes your doctor will give you a choice of a sedative or an anesthetic. You should ask about the advantages or disadvantages of both.  You should also ask about other specific instructions you should follow before and after the procedure.  These include:
> medications you should not take before the procedure, such as blood thinners or aspirin
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the procedure
Don’t forget to make arrangements for transportation to and from the facility and for help at home. Even if you are awake, you will not be allowed to drive home after your colonoscopy.","In almost all cases, a colonoscopy and removal of a polyp is safe.  Serious complications are rare,, but you should be aware of the risks and talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have.  Some of the potential risks are:
> infection
> bleeding that may need to be controlled by sealing off the blood vessel (cautery)
> a reaction to the sedation and breathing problems  
> problems with the bowel preparation
> injury to the colon
> perforation (puncture) of the bowel
After the procedure, you should let your healthcare provider know if you have any signs of infection (fever or excessive abdominal pain) or significant bleeding.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a colonoscopy and removal of a polyp?
> What is the reason for the procedure?   What other screening options are there for colon cancer besides a colonoscopy?  
> What are the advantages of colonoscopy over other screening tests for colorectal cancer?
> Do I need to fast before the procedure and, if so, for how long?  Is there any other special preparation for the procedure?  (If so, get clear instructions on what you need to do.)

This is also called coronary heart disease (CHD), arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, or “hardening of the arteries.”  When any area of the heart muscle does not receive an adequate blood supply, the result may be pain, a heart attack, an abnormal heart rhythm or even death.  
> Certain medical conditions that can lead to plaque buildup in coronary arteries, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.  Your doctor may check for those conditions as well.  
> High blood pressure is a disorder in which the pressure of blood against the walls of your arteries is too high.  Your blood pressure is high if it is 140/90 or above most of the time.  If you have diabetes, your blood pressure is considered too high if it is above 130/80.  
> Diabetes is a disorder in which your body cannot process sugar properly.  HbA1c is a blood test that measures how well your diabetes is controlled.  If you have diabetes, ask your healthcare provider what your target HbA1c should be.  
> Cholesterol is a fat (lipid) that is found in the blood.  When your cholesterol is evaluated, there are usually measurements for the so-called bad cholesterol (LDL) and the good cholesterol (HDL).  The standard lab test to check your cholesterol includes LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and your total cholesterol.  When people have too much bad cholesterol in their blood, it can lead to increased buildup of plaque in their arteries and cause problems with circulation.","There are many factors that increase your risk of getting coronary artery disease.  These factors include:  
> men over 45 and women over 55   
> family history
> high cholesterol (especially high LDL)
> high triglyceride level
> high blood pressure
> diabetes 
> smoking
> obesity
> lack of physical activity
African Americans have the highest risk of death due to coronary artery disease.

There are things you can do to decrease your risk of developing coronary artery disease.  
> Make lifestyle changes that include quitting smoking, limiting your alcohol and salt intake, exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight.  
> Keep your blood pressure, and cholesterol well controlled.
> If you have diabetes, follow your health provider’s directions on diet, exercise, and medication.  
> See your healthcare provider at recommended intervals based on your health status.

The symptoms associated with coronary artery disease can vary greatly and may not always reflect the severity of the condition.  Some of the more common symptoms include:
> chest heaviness or a squeezing sensation in your chest
> discomfort in your neck, arms, stomach, or upper back
> increased pain with activity and stress
> pain that is relieved with nitroglycerin
> shortness of breath 
> fatigue or unusual tiredness 
Women do not always have the same symptoms as men. You should contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms.  They will perform a physical examination that includes checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart.  They may also recommend some tests to evaluate the blood flow to your heart and determine how well your heart is working.  The testing can include lab tests (e.g., cholesterol and HbA1c), an EKG (electrocardiogram), an echocardiogram or other imaging studies, a stress test, or an x-ray of your coronary arteries called a coronary angiogram.","The outcome for people with coronary artery disease depends on their specific situation, including their age and overall health (other medical conditions).  Treatment usually starts with medication to control their symptoms and prevent complications.  In order to control your symptoms and prevent your coronary artery disease from worsening, it is important that you follow your healthcare provider’s instructions exactly.  
> If you have multiple risks factors for CAD, discuss preventive aspirin therapy with your healthcare provider.  Some persons should not take preventive aspirin therapy, so always check with your health care provider before doing so..
> Coronary artery disease that causes symptoms may require specific treatment, either medications or opening a clogged artery with a procedure called an angioplasty. Occasionally,  open heart surgery is required to allow blood to bypass the clogged arteries.","If you believe you have coronary artery disease or think you may be at risk for CAD, you should see your healthcare provider.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects).

M,CV008,Atrial Fibrillation - Heart Rhythm Evaluation,A-Fib | Irregular Heartbeat | EP Studies,https://client.myoptumhealth.com/myoptumhealth/guest/page.esync?view=prelogin.learn.learnLanding&command=DiseasesAndConditions&article=fc64d666b1259110VgnVCM1000005220720a____#.U0WRVuL1KOg.email,"The heart is a hollow, muscular organ with 4 chambers.  The top 2 chambers (left and right atrium) receive blood from the body and the lungs.  The bottom two chambers are called ventricles.  The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it out to the lungs.  The left ventricle receives blood from the left atrium and pumps it out to the rest of the body. The heart’s contractions are controlled by an electrical conduction system that determines the rate and rhythm of the contractions.  
> The heart's normal pacemaker initiates contractions of its four chambers in a coordinated rhythm.  A normal resting heart rate for an adult is a regular 60 to 100 beats per minute.  An arrhythmia can cause the heart to beat irregularly fast or slow.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common long-term abnormal heart rhythm.  It is an irregular heartbeat that  interferes with the heart’s ability to pump blood as effectively as it should.  Untreated, atrial fibrillation may cause a stroke.  
> Instead of normal contractions, atrial fibrillation causes the atria to “quiver.”  This can lead to blood pooling in the atria and forming clots.  When the heart contracts one of these clots, or parts of a clot, can break away and travel to other organs and tissues in the body.  If the clot goes into a blood vessel leading to the brain, it can result in a stroke.  Therefore, atrial fibrillation is often treated with a prescription blood thinner to prevent the formation of clots in the atria.
Some of the causes of atrial fibrillation include:
> excessive alcohol use 
> heart failure
> coronary artery disease 
> high blood pressure
> enlarged heart
> certain medications
> overactive thyroid gland 
> pericarditis
> heart valve disorders
However, many people with AF don’t have any of risk factors. Symptoms are not always present when someone has atrial fibrillation.  If symptoms are present, they can include palpitations, fainting, shortness of breath, and fatigue.  If you have symptoms of atrial fibrillation, you should see your health care provider right away.  Your healthcare provider will check your medical history and examine you.  A variety of tests may also be ordered to evaluate your heart.  
> An electrocardiogram (EKG) is usually the first test to detect an arrhythmia.  An EKG will reveal arrhythmias that are present at the time of the recording.  If you have symptoms that come and go, and your healthcare provider suspects that you have atrial fibrillation, a portable heart monitor may be recommended.  You will wear the monitor for anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.  This is done to pick up arrhythmias that only occasionally occur.  
> An electrophysiology study (EP study or cardiac mapping) may be done to find arrhythmias and where the abnormal electrical impulses start.  An EP study may be used in conjunction with a procedure called radiofrequency ablation to treat atrial fibrillation. This study is reserved for those persons whose AF is difficult to treat. It is generally not done on persons with newly-diagnosed AF. 
This care path includes the cost of a hospitalization, EP studies, and coronary angiogram to evaluate the heart and its electrical system.  

Atrial Fibrillation it is not immediately life-threatening, but it is serious and can cause a stroke if it is not adequately treated.  There are many different treatments for atrial fibrillation.  
> There are different medications that may be recommended to control your heart rate and rhythm.  In most cases, medication will be ordered to keep blood clots from forming.
> Cardioversion is a procedure that uses an electric shock to convert an abnormal rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation, to a normal rhythm.  (This is not the same amount of  electrical current that is given during a cardiac arrest.)  Cardioversion can also be done with medications given intravenously in the hospital. Cardioversion is usually successful in returning a person to a normal heart rhythm. However, after cardioversion atrial fibrillation may sometimes reoccur.
> Radiofrequency ablation, also called catheter ablation, is a procedure that uses
radiofrequency energy to destroy (ablate) abnormal electrical pathways.  This procedure is usually reserved for persons whose AF is difficult to treat. It is generally not done on persons with newly-diagnosed AF. 
> Surgery that involves making incisions in the atria to redirect the electrical impulses is an option if medication and other procedures do not control your atrial fibrillation. This procedure is usually reserved for persons whose AF is difficult to treat.  It is generally not done on persons with newly-diagnosed AF. 

Benefits, Risks, and More Information

Most people diagnosed with atrial fibrillation do well.  The benefits and risks of treatment for atrial fibrillation depend on the treatment.  
> Medications to control your heart rate and rhythm have different benefits and risks.  As previously noted, you may need to take a blood thinner to prevent clots from forming in your heart.  Talk to your healthcare provider about these medications, their side effects, and life style changes you will need to make.    
> Cardioversion can be an effective treatment. It is very safe.  Side effects to a cardioversion using intravenous medication vary, depending on the medication.  For both types of cardioversion, medication may still be needed to keep a normal heart rhythm.  In addition, recurring atrial fibrillation may not respond to this type of therapy.    
> Radiofrequency ablation can be effective if atrial fibrillation is caused by an “extra” pathway in the heart.  Lifelong medication is not needed and recovery time is much shorter than conventional surgery.  Risks to an ablation include perforation of a blood vessel or heart muscle, arrhythmias, blood clots, bleeding, stroke, and heart attack.

A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is a test that creates the same moving images of the heart using a probe that is placed down the throat to the lower part of the esophagus.  
> A TEE may be recommended if a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), done by moving a probe over the outside of the chest, is unclear or better images are needed to make a diagnosis.","A transesophageal echocardiogram can be done in a hospital or clinic where minor procedures and surgery are performed.  The back of your throat will be numbed and you will receive medication to help you relax.  A transducer , a device that sends and receives ultrasound waves, will be guided down the back of your throat into the lower part of your esophagus.  Once there, the transducer will send sound waves to the heart and convert the sound waves it receives back into images of the heart.  This allows the technician to obtain clear images of your heart’s structures, including the heart valves.

This care path's costs include the facility charges (the test or procedure), plus the physician charges (interpreting the test or performing the procedure).  You may get separate bills for the facility and physician charges.
","Your healthcare provider may order this test if you have any symptoms of a heart valve or blood flow problem.  It provides information about the size, shape, and structure of the heart. It can also tell how well your heart is working. 
> Echocardiography is painless, noninvasive, and does not expose you to radiation.
> The risks to having a TEE include a sore throat and reaction to the sedation (rare).

The procedure is also called a cystourethroscopy.  
> The bladder is a hollow organ that holds urine. The urethra is the tube that urine goes through as it leaves the bladder and exits the body.
> The cystoscope is inserted into the urethra and is then advanced into the bladder.
> This can help a doctor diagnose a variety of urinary tract conditions, including cancer and bladder infections. It can also help diagnose unexplained causes of painful urination.","A cystoscopy can be done with a rigid cystoscope or a flexible cystoscope.  
If you are a male, you will need to lie on your back for the exam.  If you are a female, and a rigid cystoscope is used, you will need to lie on your back with your feet in stirrups.  The position is the same as when you have a pap smear or other vaginal exam.  
> You may have some discomfort when the cystoscope is inserted and when your bladder is filled with water or salt water.  Although filling your bladder is uncomfortable, it is necessary to see the entire lining of the bladder.
> You may experience a pinching feeling if a biopsy of abnormal tissue is taken. 
> There may be a small amount of blood in your urine after the test. It may also hurt to urinate, but this discomfort should clear up after you urinate a few times.  Drinking 4 to 6 glasses of water a day after the test may help.  
> You should make plans to have someone drive you home after the exam.
Prior to the procedure, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before the procedure. These may include:
> Medications you should not take before the procedure; including medications that make your blood harder to clot (warfarin or Coumadin, aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen).

The top 2 chambers (left and right atrium) receive blood from the body and the lungs respectively.  The bottom two chambers are called ventricles.  The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it out to the lungs.  The left ventricle receives blood from the left atrium and pumps it out to the rest of the body.  Just like other muscles in our body, the heart muscle needs its own blood supply to work properly.  The arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood are called the coronary arteries.  
> The two main coronary arteries are the left and right coronary arteries.  Both the left and right coronary arteries branch off into smaller arteries.  
> When someone has coronary artery disease, he or she can develop blockages in a main coronary artery and/or in one or more of the smaller arteries that branch off from the main vessels.  The larger the coronary artery, the more heart muscle that is at risk for death if a blockage occurs.  

A standard coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is a surgery that involves taking a blood vessel (artery or vein) from the chest or other part of the body and using it to create a flow of blood around a blocked coronary artery.  Depending on the number of blockages, several blood vessels, or ""grafts,"" may be needed.
> At the start of surgery your heart may be stopped.  If your heart is stopped a heart-lung machine will be used to put oxygen into your blood and move it throughout your body.  Your surgeon will perform the necessary grafts while your heart is not moving.  Once the surgery is completed, if your heart does not start beating on its own it will be restarted with an electrical shock. ","If you have chest pain or other symptoms of coronary artery disease, your healthcare provider may refer you to a cardiologist for evaluation.  This evaluation may include an angiogram, which is a special x-ray of the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood (coronary arteries).  If the coronary angiogram shows you have coronary artery disease, your healthcare provider may recommend one of several treatments.  The treatment recommended for you will depend on the severity of your symptoms and the extent of the coronary artery disease found on your angiogram.  Treatment may include: 
>  medication
>  an angioplasty (when a special catheter is inflated inside a heart artery to press the blockage against the artery wall) and placement of a stent (a metal tube or coil that is placed in a heart artery to keep it open)
> a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), which is performed by a surgeon in an operating room
It is important to know that the majority of people who have coronary artery disease can be successfully treated with medication and by following a healthy lifestyle.

CABG surgeries are typically performed for life-threatening coronary artery diseases, such as:
> significant disease in the left main coronary artery
> disease in 3 vessels, especially if the left ventricle is also not functioning properly
> disease in 2 vessels, depending on the location of the lesion and any other heart disease
> when a blockage is accompanied by diabetes and/or decreased left ventricle function
Sometimes surgery is performed when symptoms of coronary artery disease (e.g., chest pain) cannot be controlled by any other means, such as medication.  The surgery can be completed by standard open heart surgery (either with or without a heart-lung machine), minimal invasive surgery (performed without a heart-lung machine through a smaller incision), or robotic surgery.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of surgery, so you should discuss the alternatives with your surgeon.  Based on your circumstances one or more options may not be right for you.    
This care path includes the cost of a CABG by standard open heart surgery.    

In some cases, a coronary artery bypass can be effective at controlling symptoms associated with coronary artery disease in active people (i.e. angina and shortness of breath).  It may be done in cases where it will improve those symptoms and decrease the risk of death.
> When compared to coronary angioplasty/stenting, CABG is favored if multiple vessels are blocked or a significant amount of heart muscle is at risk.  Also, people who have diabetes may do better after a CABG than after an angioplasty.  
> Remember having a CABG does not prevent future blockages.  Lifestyle changes (eating a heart-healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and not smoking) and following the recommendations of your healthcare provider are necessary to prevent future blockages.

Prior to surgery, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery and get clear instructions on what you need to do.  These may include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery
> special skin care and washing
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.  

During your surgery, you will receive general anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free.
> General anesthesia is where you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
> You will be in the intensive care unit for a period of time after surgery and will be in the hospital for about a week.  
> Your nurse will help you get out of bed as soon as possible.  This will help decrease the risk of post-operative complications, like blood clots and infection.
> Pain medication and help at home will be needed while you recover.","Open heart surgery is major surgery that has serious risks.  You should be aware of the risks and talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have.  
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the anesthesia, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and infection.  
> Risks specific to open heart surgery include an infection in the chest bone (sternum), a low-grade fever and pain in the chest for up to 6 months (post-pericardiotomy syndrome), loss of memory or clear thinking, problems with the electrical activity of the heart, heart attack or stroke, and death.  
> Your risk of complications is increased if you are older, have had previous open heart surgery, or have other major health problems. 
> You may need to take medication to stop your blood from forming clots after surgery.
> When compared to coronary angioplasty, a CABG is more expensive and has a longer recovery period.  

Most people recover well after a CABG, but it does a few months to recover.  Therefore, you may not notice a significant reduction in your symptoms for several months. 
> Newer minimally invasive surgeries, and surgeries performed on a beating heart, are showing results similar to traditional open-heart surgery.  However, these techniques are not appropriate for everyone and requires careful patient selection.","If your healthcare provider recommends a CABG, ask the following questions:  
> What is my diagnosis and reason for the surgery?  Are there any alternatives to surgery?  Why are you recommending one treatment over another?
> What are potential complications if I decide against surgery?
> What are the possible complications, how will I feel after the surgery, and how will I have to modify my activity? 
> Do I need any special tests?  What are the benefits and risks of having the tests?  
> Will the tests change your treatment recommendations?  If not, is there a need for them? 
> After surgery, what symptoms should I be concerned about?  What precautions do I need to take?
> Can my symptoms be controlled with medications?  If so, are their Tier 1 or Tier 2 medications on my Prescription Drug List that I should take?  How long will I need to take these medications?  What are the side effects of my medications? 
> How many years have you been doing this type of surgery and what are your typical results 1 year and 5 years after surgery?
> Is your facility designated as a Center of Excellence for cardiac surgery?  If so, by whom?

The top 2 chambers (left and right atrium) receive blood from the body and the lungs.  The bottom two chambers are called ventricles.  The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it out to the lungs.  The left ventricle receives blood from the left atrium and pumps it out to the rest of the body. The heart’s contractions are controlled by an electrical conduction system that determines the rate and rhythm of the contractions.  
> The heart's normal pacemaker initiates contractions of its four chambers in a coordinated rhythm.  A normal resting heart rate for an adult is a regular 60 to 100 beats per minute.  An arrhythmia can cause the heart to beat too slow, too fast, or irregularly fast or slow.
> Electrical impulses that result in life threatening fast and irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) typically start in the ventricles.  Ventricular tachycardia is when the ventricles are beating very fast.  Ventricular fibrillation is when the ventricles beat in a fast, chaotic manner.  Both of these arrhythmias can quickly lead to a cardiac arrest.   
> An implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) may be recommended if you have survived life-threatening irregular heartbeats (sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) that are not associated with a heart attack.  It may also be recommended if you are at a high risk for cardiac arrest because you have an enlarged heart, a history of heart failure, or have had a heart attack.
•Certain congenital (present at birth) heart problems or genetic health conditions

An implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) is a device that detects life-threatening arrhythmias and delivers an electrical shock to the heart to convert the rhythm back to normal.  The symptoms you might feel when an ICD discharges depend on the arrhythmia and the electrical current that is discharged by the ICD.  You might feel nothing, a minor skipping of your heart, or like you were just kicked in the chest.  Any discomfort after the ICD discharges should be brief and resolve quickly.
> A normal heartbeat usually returns after a single shock.  If several shocks occur during a brief period, you should seek medical attention to have your heart and ICD evaluated. 

The two parts of an ICD are the leads and a generator.  The leads conduct electrical impulses from the generator to the heart muscle. 
> The generator is small and powered by a lithium battery, which lasts from 4 to 6 years.  How long the battery lasts depends on how often the ICD needs to restore your normal heart rhythm. 
> There are several types of ICDs; newer ICDs also have the ability to act as a pacemaker.  The type of ICD your healthcare provider recommends will depend on your general health, medical history, current diagnosis, and the provider’s preferences.  
> ICDs are typically inserted just below the collarbone, in the soft tissue outside the ribs. They can later be analyzed and programmed electronically. 
> ICDs may also be used to treat atrial fibrillation, heart failure, a heart attack that has weakened your heart, an enlarged heart, or an inherited heart defect that makes your heart beat abnormally (such as long QT syndrome).","Implantable cardiac defibrillators are used to interrupt a very fast and/or irregular heart rhythm.  To see if an ICD is the correct treatment for you, your healthcare provider will do a complete physical exam and likely recommend some tests.
> An electrocardiogram (EKG) will reveal problems with your heart rate or rhythm that are present at the time of the recording.  Holter monitoring can provide a continuous recording of your heart’s electrical activity for 24 to 72 hours.  
> A chest x-ray can show if your heart is enlarged, inflamed, or surrounded with fluid.  Other types of cardiac imaging may be done, such as an echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) or heart nuclear scan (studies heart function and blood flow).
> An electrophysiology study (EP study or cardiac mapping) may be done to detect arrhythmias and problems with your heart’s electrical system.

An ICD is typically inserted by a cardiologist in a cardiac catheterization laboratory.  During surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free.  General anesthesia is when you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  In some cases, local anesthesia and a relaxing medication is used.  
> Your cardiologist will create a ""pocket,"" by numbing the area and making a small incision in the skin under your right or left collarbone.  The generator will be placed in the pocket and the lead wires will be threaded to your heart.  (Tell your doctor if you have a preference for which side you would like the generator placed.)  
> After the procedure, a chest x-ray will be done to confirm proper positioning of the leads and check for any possible problems.  Additional electrocardiograms may be done before you're discharged.
> After insertion of an ICD, you might need to stay in the hospital for a day or two.
> You may need pain medication and help at home while you recover.

Don’t forget to ask your cardiologist for any specific instructions to follow after surgery.  This can include not driving or lifting your arm above your shoulder for about a week.  Although you may be able to resume most normal activities right away, you should avoid strenuous activities for at least two weeks. 
> Before you drive, check with your healthcare provider about the rules for people driving with an ICD in place. 
> Contact your healthcare provider if your ICD is firing frequently, your original symptoms return, your pulse becomes abnormal, you develop prolonged hiccups, or your arm or chest muscles are twitching.  
> Before medical or dental procedures, let the provider know you have an ICD. 
> If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.","An ICD can reduce the risk of dying from cardiac arrest (a condition in which your heart stops beating) or a dangerous irregular heartbeat.  Most people who have an ICD inserted do well. Complications are uncommon, but may include:
> a reaction to the anesthesia
> puncture of the lung, vein, or heart by a needle or the lead wires
> infection or bleeding of the generator pocket
> mechanical or electrical failure of the leads or generator
Replacing the generator requires a second surgical procedure, but it is simpler than the original surgery.  Replacing the leads (rarely needed) is similar to the original surgery. 

Due to the device's electrical nature, there are some things you should keep in mind after your ICD is inserted.  
> You may need to avoid MRI scans, electrical generators, power plants, ham radios, and junkyards with large magnets.  You may also need to avoid working on running car engines or using arc welding equipment.  
> Your ICD may set off metal detectors, but they won't affect its functioning.  Airport security should use hand searching and not handheld metal detectors.
> A cell phone may interfere with your ICD.  It is generally safe to talk on a cell phone, but keep a distance of 8 inches between the phone and ICD generator.  Do not carry a cell phone or iPod that's on in a breast pocket over the generator.  It is generally safe to use a cordless phone. 
> Don't linger in store entrances or exits.  If exposure is prolonged, the antitheft devices may affect your ICD.
> You may see warnings, but modern ICDs are not affected by microwave ovens.","If your healthcare provider recommends an ICD, ask him or her the following questions.

The top 2 chambers (left and right atrium) receive blood from the body and the lungs respectively.  The bottom 2 chambers are called ventricles.  The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it out to the lungs.  The left ventricle receives blood from the left atrium and pumps it out to the rest of the body. There are four one-way valves in the heart that help direct and regulate blood flow through the heart.  These are the tricuspid, aortic, mitral, and pulmonic valves.
> The tricuspid valve controls the blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. 
> The pulmonic valve controls the blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, which carries blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. 
> The mitral valve controls blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. 
> The aortic valve controls the blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta, which carries blood out to the body. 
Heart valve disorders are usually divided into two types.  Stenosis is narrowing of a valve, which causes a decreased flow of blood through the narrowed space.  Regurgitation occurs when a valve does not close completely, leading to a backward flow of blood through the valve.   

Replacement of a damaged heart valve to treat stenosis or regurgitation is usually done using open-heart surgery.  A damaged valve can be replaced with a biological valve (a human valve or a valve made from pig or cow tissue).  It may also be replaced with a mechanical valve (made from metal and carbon).  Biological valves may also contain some artificial parts. 
> At the start of surgery your heart may be stopped.  If your heart is stopped a heart-lung machine will be used to put oxygen into your blood and move it throughout your body.  Your surgeon will perform the valve replacement while your heart is not moving.  Once the surgery is completed, if your heart does not start beating on its own it will be restarted with an electrical shock. 
> Newer, less invasive surgeries (such as a procedure that replaces the valve through a catheter while the heart is still beating), may be an alternative for people who are not good candidates for traditional open heart surgery.
> In some cases, a damaged valve may be repaired instead of being replaced.  This is most commonly the case with the mitral and tricuspid valves, which are not operated on as often.","Heart valve disorders may be congenital or develop later in life.  Some causes of heart valve disease may include: 
> infection of the heart valve (such as bacterial endocarditis) 
> rheumatic fever
> inflammation of the inner lining of the heart 
> high blood pressure and/or increased blood pressure in the lungs
> heart disease (such as coronary artery disease and heart failure) 
> connective tissue disorders (such as Marfan's syndrome) 
> autoimmune conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis) 
> trauma (such as a blunt trauma to the chest or an injury from a cardiac procedure) 
> a rare cancer that can damage heart valves or a tumor of the heart 
> certain medications 

Mild heart valve disorders may not result in any symptoms.  A severe heart valve disorder can cause: 
> chest pain or discomfort
> shortness of breath, especially with exertion 
> palpitations (a feeling of thumping, fluttering, skipping, or racing of the heart) 
> fatigue 
> dizziness or lightheadedness 
> syncope (sudden brief loss of consciousness) 
> heart failure
> sudden death.
With severe disease affecting the tricuspid or pulmonic valves (the valves on the right side of the heart), additional symptoms can include swelling of the arms and legs, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, and upper right abdominal discomfort. 

If you have developed any of the above symptoms, see your healthcare provider.  He or she will check your medical history, give you a physical exam, and listen to your heart with a stethoscope to listen for ""extra"" heart sounds (murmurs).  Heart murmurs can occur when blood is being forced through a narrow valve or is leaking back through a valve.  Based on the exam, you may be referred to a cardiologist or surgeon for evaluation.  A variety of tests may also be ordered to evaluate your heart.  However, if you don't have symptoms, close monitoring may be sufficient. 
> An electrocardiogram (EKG) can assess the electrical activity of your heart.  
> Blood and urine tests can provide information about your general health. 
> A chest x-ray can show if your heart is enlarged.  Other types of cardiac imaging include an echocardiogram (heart ultrasound), transesophageal echocardiogram (heart ultrasound done by placing a sensor down your throat into the esophagus), or heart nuclear scan (procedure that studies heart function and blood flow).  
> An exercise stress test can help your doctor determine how well your heart is working under stress.  This test can also be done with radioactive thallium, which shows up on an x-ray and can help your doctor diagnose impaired blood flow in the heart muscle. 
> A cardiac catheterization (when a small flexible tube is fed through a blood vessel in the groin into the heart to examine the heart and its arteries) and/or coronary angiogram (when a small flexible tube is used to open a blocked heart artery) may be done to study your heart and its blood vessels.
You may need to take antibiotics before certain procedures if you have a history of an infection of the inner lining of the heart, a mechanical valve replacement, a valve repair with mechanical material, or a complex congenital heart defect.

Heart valve replacements or repairs can be completed by standard open heart surgery (either with or without a heart-lung machine), one of several minimally invasive techniques (through a small incision in the skin or using a laparoscope or endoscope), or robotic surgery.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of surgery, so you should discuss the alternatives with your surgeon.  Based on your circumstances one or more options may not be right for you.

> Your risk of complications increases if you are over 75, your left ventricle does not work well, you’ve had a previous heart attack or open heart surgery, or you have other major health problems. 
> Depending on the type of valve you have, you may need to take medication to stop your blood from forming clots after surgery.

Valve replacement can improve heart function and provide lasting relief of the symptoms associated with valve stenosis and regurgitation. 
> With the minimally invasive technique, there's a smaller incision, less pain and bleeding, a shorter hospital stay, and faster recovery.  If this type of surgery is recommend, ask your surgeon about his experience performing this surgery and what their typical outcomes are?
> Biological valves are durable (newer ones can last more than 20 years).  People who have biological valves usually don't need to take anticoagulants (blood thinners).  They are often recommended for women who may want to get pregnant and people who have a history of endocarditis, are older than age 50, are at high risk for trauma, and are unlikely to take blood thinners as prescribed.
> Mechanical valves typically last for the remainder of the recipient’s life.  They are often recommended for younger people and people who take blood thinners for other reasons.  Mechanical valves increase the risk of blood clots, so blood thinners must be taken indefinitely.  You will need to have your blood monitored frequently because blood thinners increase the risk of bleeding.  
> The ticking sound of certain mechanical valves can be bothersome for some people.","If your healthcare provider recommends a valve replacement, ask the following questions.  
> What's wrong with my heart valve and which valve is affected?  Are there any alternatives to surgery?  Why are you recommending one treatment over another?

The top 2 chambers (left and right atrium) receive blood from the body and the lungs.  The bottom two chambers are called ventricles.  The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it out to the lungs.  The left ventricle receives blood from the left atrium and pumps it out to the rest of the body. The heart’s contractions are controlled by an electrical conduction system that determines the rate and rhythm of the contractions.  
> The heart's normal pacemaker initiates contractions of its four chambers in a coordinated rhythm.  A normal resting heart rate for an adult is a regular 60 to 100 beats per minute.  An arrhythmia can cause the heart to beat too slow, too fast, or irregularly fast or slow.
> If the heart's electrical system is not working properly, an artificial pacemaker may be needed.  Sometimes a pacemaker is needed if you must take medication that causes a slow heartbeat.  

An artificial pacemaker helps your heart beat at a normal rate and rhythm when your body's natural pacemaker isn't working effectively.  The two parts of a pacemaker are the leads and a generator.  The leads conduct electrical impulses from the generator to the heart muscle. 
> The generator is small and powered by a lithium battery, which usually lasts from 5 to 10 years.  The type of pacemaker your healthcare provider recommends will depend on your general health, medical history, current diagnosis, and his or her preferences.  
> Pacemakers can be programmed to stimulate the heart to beat at a steady rate or at the rate needed to support your physical activity and energy requirements.
> Permanent pacemakers are typically inserted just below the collarbone, in the soft tissue outside the ribs.  They can later be analyzed and programmed electronically. 
> Pacemakers may also be used to treat other conditions (atrial fibrillation, heart failure).","Pacemakers are most often used when the heart rhythm is too slow (called bradycardia if less than 60 beats per minute).  In some cases, a pacemaker may be used to interrupt a fast heart rhythm (called tachycardia if more than 100 beats per minute).  Symptoms that occur when your heart beats to slow include dizziness, fainting, exercise intolerance, and symptoms of heart failure (such as shortness of breath).  Contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of a low heart rate.  He or she will do a complete physical exam and review your medications to make sure they are not causing a problem with your hearts rhythm.  Your healthcare provider may also recommend some tests.
> An electrocardiogram (EKG) will reveal problems with your heart rate or rhythm that are present at the time of the recording.  Holter monitoring can provide a continuous recording of your heart’s electrical activity for 24 to 72 hours.  
> An electrophysiology study (EP study or cardiac mapping) may be done to detect arrhythmias and problems with your heart’s electrical system.

A pacemaker is typically inserted by a cardiologist in a cardiac catheterization laboratory.  During the procedure, your cardiologist will create a ""pocket"" by numbing the area and making a small incision in the skin under your right or left collarbone. (Tell your doctor if you have a preference for which side you would like the generator placed.)  The generator will be put in the pocket and the lead wires will be threaded to your heart.    
> You may be given some medicine to relax.  However, you will be awake for the procedure and may feel some discomfort where the pacemaker is inserted.  
> After the procedure a chest x-ray will be done to confirm proper positioning of the leads and check for any possible problems. Additional electrocardiograms will likely be done before you're discharged.
> Many people who receive pacemakers go home the same day or the next morning.
> You may need pain medication and help at home while you recover.

Don’t forget to ask your cardiologist for any specific instructions to follow after surgery.  This can include not driving or lifting your arm above your shoulder for about a week.  You may be able to resume most normal activities right away, but you should avoid strenuous activities for at least two weeks. 
> You may learn how to transmit data from the pacemaker to your cardiologist through your home phone. This helps ensure your pacemaker is working properly. 
> Contact your healthcare provider if your original symptoms return, your pulse becomes abnormal, you develop prolonged hiccups, or your arm or chest muscles are twitching.  
> Before medical or dental procedures, let the provider know you have a pacemaker. 
> If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.   

This care path includes the costs of a pacemaker inserted as an outpatient.
","By stimulating your heart to beat at a normal rate, a pacemaker can allow you to enjoy an improved or even normal activity level.  Most people that have a pacemaker do very well and complications are uncommon.  Possible complications can include:
> a reaction to the anesthesia
> puncture of the lung, vein, or heart by a needle or the lead wires
> infection or bleeding of the pacemaker pocket
> mechanical or electrical failure of the leads or generator
Replacing the generator requires a second surgical procedure, but it is simpler than the original surgery.  Replacing the leads (rarely needed) is similar to the original surgery. 

Due to the device's electrical nature, there are some things you should keep in mind if you have a pacemaker.  
> You may need to avoid MRI scans, electrical generators, power plants, ham radios, and junkyards with large magnets.  You may also need to avoid working on running car engines or using arc welding equipment.  
> Your pacemaker may set off metal detectors, but they won't affect its functioning.  Airport security should use hand searching and not handheld metal detectors. 
> A cell phone may interfere with your pacemaker.  It is generally safe to talk on a cell phone, but keep 8 inches between the phone and pacemaker.  Do not carry a cell phone or iPod that's on in a breast pocket over a pacemaker.  It is generally safe to use a cordless phone. 
> Don't linger in store entrances/exits with antitheft devices; prolonged exposure may affect your pacemaker.  
> You may see warnings, but modern pacemakers are not affected by microwave ovens.","If your healthcare provider recommends a pacemaker, ask him or her the following questions.  
> Do I need any special tests?  What are the benefits and risks of having the tests?  
> Will the tests change your treatment recommendations?  If not, is there a need for them? 
> Why do I need a pacemaker?  What are my treatment options and what is the best treatment for me? What are the risks of each one? 
>What are the different brands and types of pacemakers?  Which one do you prefer, and why?  How does one compare to another? 
> After the pacemaker is inserted, what symptoms should I be concerned about?  What precautions do I need to take?
> Can my symptoms be controlled with medications?  If so, are their Tier 1 or Tier 2 medications on my Prescription Drug List that I should take?  How long will I need to take these medications?  What are my medications side effects?

This occurs when there is a lack of insulin or when the insulin that is present is less effective than it should be and is insufficient to meet the body’s needs.  The ability to process glucose, or use it for energy, depends on the body being able to produce and use insulin.  Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas; its job is to move glucose from the blood into cells in certain tissue so the glucose can be used for energy.  When the body does not produce enough insulin, or is unable to effectively use the insulin that is produced (insulin resistance), increased levels of glucose result.  There are 3 main types of diabetes; type 1 diabetes (previously called juvenile onset diabetes), type 2 diabetes (previously called adult onset diabetes), and gestational diabetes (diabetes occurring during pregnancy).   
> Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body makes very little or no insulin.  In order for the body to use glucose for energy, and keep blood sugars under control, daily insulin injections are needed.  This type of diabetes is usually diagnosed in younger people (children, teens, or young adults), and often appears to have an acute or quick onset.  
> Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body does not make enough insulin and/or is unable to effectively use the insulin it does make (insulin resistance).  Often, certain medications taken by mouth can help the body release more insulin or help the body use it more effectively.  However, some people with type 2 diabetes will require insulin injections.  This type of diabetes is usually diagnosed in middle aged or older people, but is becoming more common in younger people due to the increase in obesity and sedentary lifestyles.  The symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly and are rarely severe at the start.  Therefore, people often do not know they have this condition.  
> Gestational diabetes occurs when a non-diabetic woman develops high blood sugar levels during her pregnancy.  This condition can lead to complications with the pregnancy and requires careful management to help ensure the best possible outcome for mother and child.  Some women who have gestational diabetes eventually develop Type 2 diabetes.  Therefore, those women need periodic surveillance even when they are not pregnant.","The risk factors for diabetes vary depending on the type of diabetes you have.  The cause of type 1 diabetes is not known for sure, but genetics and other unidentified factors appear to play a role.  It appears that a reaction of the body’s immune system against the cells that produce insulin is involved.  Risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes include:
> age (those over 45 years have increased risk)
> genetic factors and family history
> obesity or being overweight
> lack of physical activity or exercise (sedentary lifestyle)
> high blood pressure
> high triglycerides or low good cholesterol (HDL)
> ethnicity (African Americans, Mexican Americans and Native Americans have a higher risk for the disease)
> history of gestational diabetes or prediabetes
There are steps you can take to decrease your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  These include making lifestyle changes such as exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight.  Don’t forget to see your healthcare provider at appropriate intervals for recommended diabetes screening and for his or her assistance in developing an exercise program and a healthy diet.

The symptoms associated with high blood sugars due to diabetes can vary greatly, depending on the actual blood sugar levels and how long the person has had the disease.  Some of the more common symptoms, usually associated with Type 1 diabetes,  include:
> problems with eyesight
> unexplained weight loss
> urinating frequently
> feeling thirsty all the time
> being hungry, even when you have eaten
> having persistent fatigue
>feelings of tingling, numbness, and pain in hands and feet
> developing cuts or sores that do not heal properly
You should contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms.  They will perform a physical examination and may recommend some blood tests to find out the cause.  These tests can include a fasting blood sugar (done in the morning before you eat), and a HbA1c (reflects your average blood sugar over the previous few months).  A glucose tolerance test, which measures your blood sugars at specific intervals after you have swallowed a sweet liquid, may occasionally be recommended, particularly to help diagnose gestational diabetes.  
> Diabetes cannot be diagnosed by a urine test, and, often, blood tests for the disease need to be repeated before a definite diagnosis is made.","When the blood sugar remains elevated for an extended period of time, it can cause problems with many other parts of the body.  Some of the complications related to diabetes include:
> heart disease
> kidney disease
> problems with of vision
> stroke
> problems with circulation, especially in the legs and feet
> cuts or sores that don’t heal properly
> damage to nerves
Since heart disease is a major complication of diabetes, it is important that you work on decreasing the risk factors for heart disease that you can change.  For example, you will want to stop smoking, maintain your blood pressure in a healthy range, exercise regularly, manage your weight, and get your cholesterol level into the range recommended by your doctor.  

There is currently no cure for either type of diabetes.  However, there is some evidence that managing weight and physical activity may delay or prevent pre-diabetes from progressing to Type 2 diabetes. The outcome for people with diabetes depends on the type of diabetes they have, how well they manage their blood sugars, and their overall health (other medical conditions, especially risk factors for heart disease).  A healthy lifestyle is an important part of the treatment plan for all forms of diabetes.  For type 1 diabetes, frequent monitoring of blood sugar and multiple daily insulin injections are required.  For type 2 diabetes, medications are given which can stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin and make the body’s use of insulin more efficient.  As time goes on, increased numbers of people with type 2 diabetes also require insulin. 
> In some extreme cases, weight loss surgery has been helpful for people with type 2 diabetes.  
> In order to control your blood sugar and prevent complications, it is important that you completely follow your healthcare provider’s instructions.  
> Insulin and many other diabetes medications can cause low blood sugar, also called hypoglycemia.  This can occasionally be severe and, rarely, life-threatening.  Everybody with diabetes, and their families, should recognize the symptoms of low blood sugar and should learn how to treat it immediately.
> People with diabetes should wear a bracelet identifying them as having diabetes.  This is so that if they have symptoms of low blood sugar, others can provide immediate assistance. 
> Most people with any type of diabetes will benefit from participating in a Diabetes Education Program, which is available at many hospitals. Such programs will teach persons with diabetes how to recognize symptoms of high and low blood sugar; how to test blood sugar using a glucose meter and test tapes; and how to self-administer diabetes medications, including insulin.","If you believe you have diabetes, you should see your healthcare provider.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.  It is particularly important to know what your risk for heart disease is and to discuss a plan to decrease that risk.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects).

The tiny hairs transmit the information to the brain, which results in our hearing sounds.  Different sounds produce different vibrations; this may explain the difference in how we hear them.  
> When the tiny hairs become damaged or destroyed, a person’s hearing is decreased, because the signals are not being properly sent to the brain.","Some hearing loss is a normal part of aging; however, there are some causes of hearing loss that have nothing to do with growing old.  While the tiny hairs inside the ear can be damaged by aging, they can also be damaged by exposing the ears to loud noises on a regular basis.  Some other causes of hearing loss are a buildup of wax in the ear, frequent ear infections (causing damage to the inner ear), a hole in the air drum (ruptured ear drum), or abnormal bone growths or tumors in the ear.  You have an increased risk for age-related hearing loss if you have:
> a family history (age-related hearing loss tends to run in families)
> certain medical conditions and medicines
> a history of smoking

You may have some hearing loss if sounds appear muffled; you have trouble picking up what people are saying, especially if there are other noises in the background; you need people to repeat things a lot; or you need to have the volume on the TV or radio turned up louder than most other people.  People with hearing loss may also tend to avoid social gatherings and participation in active discussions. Sometimes hearing loss can be so gradual that a person is not aware of it; however, other family members may notice that you are asking that they repeat things they say to you.  If you or your family are concerned about your hearing, you should see your healthcare provider.  They will do a physical examination, including a hearing  test, to determine if there is a medical cause for the decrease in your hearing.  Sometimes, if there is a lot of wax in your ears, cleaning out the wax may be enough to improve your hearing.  

Although age-related hearing loss is usually permanent, there are things that can improve your confidence and quality of life; these include:
> hearing aids
> telephone amplifiers and other assistive devices
> use of lip reading and sign language, if hearing loss is severe
> Bone-anchored hearing aids also be option if your hearing loss is severe, but it is important to know that it will not make your hearing normal.","People with age-related hearing loss are at risk for certain safety issues (not hearing a car or fire alarm), depression, anxiety, and social isolation.

It is also known as a hallux valgus.  Bunions can develop when the big toe is pushed into the toe beside it.  This causes the joint of the big toe to get larger and stick out the side of the foot.  A bunionectomy is  the removal of excessive bony tissue at the base of the big toe.  This gives the surgeon room to straighten the affected toe.  Wire, pins, or screws may be used to keep the toe straight. 
> A bunion may also develop at the base of the little toe.  This is referred to as a bunionette or a tailor's bunion.","Bunions are extremely common.  Due to the shape of their foot, some people have a genetic predisposition to bunions.  Women and those with flat feet or low arches are also more prone to bunions.  Other causes of bunions include: 
> bone or joint diseases, such as arthritis 
> injuries 
> wearing shoes that are too small, squeeze the toes together, or have high-heels
> having an occupation that puts stress on the feet, such as dancing and athletics 

Most persons with bunions have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. However, bunions can cause pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the bunion.  In addition, constant rubbing of shoes can irritate a bunion and thicken the skin over the joint.  The affected toe often begins to point toward the other toes instead of straight ahead.  Some ways to prevent complications associated with a bunion include:
> using shoe padding or shields
> wearing wide-width shoes
> pain medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen
< certain lifestyle change
If nonsurgical measures for a bunion aren't effective and the bunion is painful, a bunionectomy may be appropriate.  A bunionectomy can relieve foot pain, correct a deformity, improve toe function, and enable normal walking and related activities.
Bunion surgery can be performed by a foot doctor (podiatrist) or a foot and ankle surgeon. However, you should always start with a visit to your primary healthcare provider if you have concerns about whether you have a bunion and what you should do about it. 

Prior to surgery, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery and get clear instructions on what you need to do.  These may include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.  

During your surgery, you will receive medication to keep you comfortable and pain free. > A bunionectomy can often be done with an ankle block (which only numbs your foot).  > In certain circumstances, general anesthesia (where you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything) or spinal anesthesia (which numbs you from the waist down) may be used.

After surgery, expect some pain and tenderness at the site.  Call your healthcare provider if you experience uncontrolled bleeding, more pain than anticipated, increased redness or swelling, discharge from the wound, fever, warmth around the incision, or red streaks.   
> Your doctor may limit your activity for a few weeks.  When you can resume weight-bearing activities may depend on the type of bunionectomy you had. 
> You may need to wear a special support shoe while your foot is healing.  This may take six to 12 weeks.  In some cases, a cast may be applied to hold your foot in position. 
> You may need to permanently avoid certain types of shoes, such as high heels.","A bunionectomy can decrease or relieve foot pain caused by a bunion.  However, keep in mind that most people with bunions do not need a bunionectomy.  As with any surgery there are risks that you should be aware of and discuss with your surgeon.  
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the anesthesia, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and infection.  
> Risks specific to a bunionectomy include re-occurrence of the bunion, damage to foot blood vessels or nerves, loss of circulation to the toe, development of a stiff toe, misalignment of the toe, delayed or incomplete healing, and continued or increased pain after surgery.
> The affected toe may be shorter after surgery and you will most likely be able to fit into more shoe styles than you could before surgery.
","If your healthcare provider recommends a bunionectomy, ask the following questions.  
> Why do you think I need a bunionectomy?  What do you expect will happen if I do not have a bunionectomy?
> What treatment options do you recommend?  What are the advantages and  risks to each treatment? 
> Are there any alternatives to surgery that can relieve my symptoms?
> Will I need surgery for the other foot? 
> How can I prevent future bunions?
> What are the possible complications, how will I feel after the surgery, and how will I have to modify my activity? 
> After surgery, what symptoms should I be concerned about?  What precautions do I need to take?
Prior to discharge, you should understand all home care instructions.  This includes symptoms to report before your next appointment, medications and their side effects, and follow-up plans.

> The smaller stomach does not secrete as much of a hormone called ghrelin. This decreases the sensation of hunger.
A sleeve gastrectomy may also be done to help with weight loss before another, more extensive type of weight loss surgery usually called gastric bypass surgery.

Weight loss surgery is not a cure for obesity, but rather one of the tools used to enhance weight loss. Certain lifestyle changes are necessary for the surgery to be successful.  Some lifestyle changes include getting regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and following the recommendations of your healthcare providers.  Prior to considering weight loss surgery, you should know your BMI, or Body Mass Index.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has an online tool to help you determine your BMI.  Here are some of the criteria that are used to determine who may be a candidate for weight loss surgery.  
> You do not have a significant mental illness or active dependence on drugs or alcohol so that you will be able to follow instructions given to you that will need to be carried out after your surgery has been performed.  
> You have severe obesity that has been present for over 5 years and has not responded to diet, exercise, and medication.   
> You have a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 40 or more.  For men, that typically means at least 100 pounds overweight.  For women, it typically means at least 80 pounds overweight.  
> You have a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 35 along with another medical condition that could be improved by weight loss (for example, diabetes, sleep apnea, high blood pressure, or heart disease).  
Before any weight loss surgery, you will meet with a dietician and mental health provider.  The goal of these visits is to teach you about the diet you must follow and make sure you are ready for the significant lifestyle changes you must make for a positive outcome.  Prior to surgery, you should tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery.  These may include:
> a special diet and exercise program
> medications you should not take before the procedure, such as blood thinners or aspirin
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure but not within 8 hours of the start of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.  

During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia, the most common type of anesthesia for this surgery, is where you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
You may stay in the hospital, at the most, for 3 to 5 days to recover from the surgery assuming that there have been no complications to your surgery.  During the first day or two, you will not be able to eat. You may have a tube in your nose to keep your stomach empty.  When you are ready to eat, you will start with liquids and pureed food.     

After surgery, you should know what you had done and what symptoms you should report to your healthcare provider.  You should also understand all home care instructions (including medications and side effects) and follow-up plans.  Your surgeon should also let your primary care physician know the details of your surgery and treatment plan.
> Your treatment plan will likely include follow-up classes and meetings with a dietician.
> Pain medication and help at home may be needed while you recover. 
","The outcome after weight loss surgery is typically good. Most people lose weight successfully.  However, your outcome depends on your commitment to making necessary lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, and following your healthcare provider’s recommendations.  (Those recommendations include attending all follow up visits and meetings that are routinely scheduled after weight loss surgery.)  After surgery, you will be on a liquid or pureed diet and will lose weight quickly during that time.  As you add more food to your diet, your weight loss will be slower, but you should continue to lose weight for several years after surgery. You should always avoid high caloric drinks.
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and various infections.  
> Risks specific to this type of surgery are varied and include infection, injury to the abdominal organs, leakage of stomach contents, poor nutrition, acid reflux, excessive nausea or vomiting, hernia, tightening of the gastric sleeve, and blockage in the bowels.  
> When compared to gastric bypass surgery, there's typically less weight loss after a sleeve gastrectomy.  However, it appears to be safer and have fewer complications. 
> A sleeve gastrectomy also results in a greater decrease in the production of the gastrointestinal hormone ghrelin, which leads to a decrease in hunger.   
> If you do not adhere to the required lifestyle changes, you may regain the weight you lost. 
> Weight loss surgery increases your risk of developing gallstones in the future.  Your healthcare provider may recommend medication for several months after surgery to prevent gallstones.
> A sleeve gastrectomy cannot be reversed.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having weight loss surgery?

The uric acid deposits lead to recurring attacks of pain and inflammation, frequently in the joint at the base of the big toe.  These attacks can develop rapidly and often happen at night.  
> Although the exact cause of gout is not known, most cases are related to a decrease in the kidney's ability to eliminate the uric acid that the body normally produces.  
> Some other causes of gout include an increased production of uric acid in the body and the consumption of alcohol or foods high in purines (shellfish, organ meats, anchovies, sardines, bacon, veal, and venison).  Purines are a type of chemical found in all plants and animals.
> Some medications can increase the risk of gout.
> Before age 60, men develop gout more often than women.  However, after age 60, men and women are affected equally.  Gout is uncommon in children.","Gout usually affects one joint at a time, often the joint at the base of the big toe.  However, joints in the knees, ankles, feet, elbows, or hands can also be affected.  During an acute attack, affected joints become red, painful, swollen, warm, and difficult to use.  Gout attacks normally last about a week and, in some cases, can go away on their own.  However, other attacks typically follow within the next few months or years.  With time, the attacks may occur more often and last longer and cause significant joint damage.  Some people can also develop a moderate fever or the chills during an attack. 

Diagnosing gout early is important to delay and limit joint damage and other possible complications and limit pain, which can be severe.  Contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms.  He or she will take a medical history, perform a physical exam, order lab tests, and possibly remove fluid from an affected joint.
> A diagnosis can frequently  be made by a doctor after taking your medical history and examining you.
>The diagnosis can be confirmed by identifying uric acid crystals in fluid removed from the affected joint.  
> Blood tests showing high uric acid levels do not always indicate gout.  Many people with high uric acid levels never develop gout and normal uric acid levels can occur during a gout attack. 
> An x-ray, CT scan, or MRI may be helpful in diagnosing joint damage from inflammation caused by gout. 

Although there is no cure for gout, the condition can usually be controlled through medication, diet, and lifestyle changes.  The goals are to treat sudden attacks, prevent future attacks and joint damage, and control uric acid levels.  Prevention of acute attacks is the mainstay of gout management. 
Your healthcare provider may also prescribe medication to relieve pain and inflammation and help prevent future attacks.  These are two different types of medications. Make sure you tell your provider if you have other health problems, such as cardiac disease or gastrointestinal problems.  Sometimes, a corticosteroid medication may be injected directly into the affected joint. ","Chronic gout can lead to persistent pain in the affected joint(s), damage of the tissues in and around the joint(s), and the development of deposits of uric acid crystals that produce lumps on the fingers, hands, wrists, elbows, ankles, knees, feet or outer ears.  Gout may also lead to kidney stones and kidney damage.  To prevent complications, seek an early diagnosis and begin treatment as soon as possible.
> Attacks of gout may be triggered by  heavy alcohol use, excessive dietary intake of purines, dehydration, fasting or extremely low-calorie diets, and use of certain medications or cancer chemotherapy treatments

Various factors may increase the risk of developing gout, including: 
> a family history of gout 
> obesity 
> diabetes 
> menopause 
> high blood pressure and

It can be very difficult, even for a trained healthcare provider, to decide whether hives are due to an allergy, infection, or other cause.
","Hives may not happen the first time a person is exposed to a substance. It can take several exposures before the body responds with hives.  Treatment for hives is based on removing the source, decreasing the symptoms, and monitoring for severe reactions.  
> In some cases, a cream may be prescribed to help decrease itching. 
> Hot showers or baths should be avoided.

When you get your numbers, use this as a guide: the top number indicates the pressure when the heart is contracting (known as systolic) and the bottom number indicates the pressure when the heart is relaxed (known as diastolic). 
> High blood pressure is when your blood pressure is above 140/90 most of the time. 
> If you have diabetes, your blood pressure is too high when it is above 130/80.
> Pre-hypertension is when your blood pressure is above 120/80, but lower than 140/90.","In most cases, high blood pressure does not cause any symptoms and is often found during a routine blood pressure check.  
> Because there are no symptoms, people can develop complications from high blood pressure without even knowing they have it.  Some of the signs of seriously high blood pressure include a severe headache, nausea or vomiting, confusion, changes in your vision, or nosebleeds.
> If you have high blood pressure, you should check with your healthcare provider before taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen. 
> Your potassium and kidney function should be tested regularly if you are on certain medications for high blood pressure.
> Regular physical activity, eating a heart-healthy diet, quitting smoking, limiting your alcohol and salt, reducing stress, and maintaining a healthy weight can help control your blood pressure and improve a variety of other medical conditions.
> Many people with high blood pressure are also at risk for other conditions, such as high blood cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke; your doctor may check for those conditions, as well.","The cause of high blood pressure is not always known.  Your blood pressure can be affected by the amount of water and salt in your body, hormones, and other medical conditions.  Age and genetics are also factors. As you get older, your blood vessels become stiffer and loose their ability to relax; this can make your blood pressure go up. 
> When your blood pressure is above normal, it is more difficult for your heart to pump blood out to the body.  
> Pre-hypertension increases your risk for developing high blood pressure.
> Your healthcare provider may want your blood pressure to be a little below normal if you have a history of heart disease, problems with your kidneys, or have had a stroke. 
> You’re at a  greater risk of high blood pressure if you are African American, are overweight, frequently anxious, drink a lot of alcohol, eat too much salt, have a family history of high blood pressure, have diabetes, or smoke.
> No matter what the cause, having your blood pressure checked regularly and treated appropriately can help prevent health issues associated with high blood pressure.  These include stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney disease, and early death.","If you believe you have high blood pressure, you should see your healthcare provider.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects).

The instruments are inserted into 3 or 4 small cuts in the abdomen.  It is also known as a laparoscopic resection of the small intestine.  
> The main function of the small intestines is to break down and absorb nutrients.  
> Occasionally, parts of the small intestines become blocked or unhealthy (e.g., inflamed or infected).  A small bowel resection is done to remove the unhealthy part of the bowel and sew the two healthy ends together.  
> Rarely, there is no healthy tissue to sew together.  In those cases, the loose end of the bowel is brought out of the body through a hole made in the abdomen (a stoma).  Stomas can be temporary, to allow the affected part of the bowel time to heal, or they can be permanent.","A resection of your small bowel may be recommended if you have a blockage in your small intestines that cannot be removed, severe disease of the small intestines (e.g., infection, inflammation, death of bowel tissue due to blockage of blood supply, bleeding), tumors or growths (benign or cancerous), or an injury to the small intestine.

The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen.  The esophagus goes through the diaphragm through a small opening called the hiatus.  Hiatal hernias can occur when the muscle that supports the hiatus has a weakness that allows a part of the stomach to protrude up through the hiatus.  There are two types of hiatal hernias.  One is the sliding hiatal hernia, which often goes undetected or remains uncomplicated. The other is the paraesophageal hernia, which is an excessively large hiatal hernia.  A paraesophageal hernia is less common, but more likely to lead to complications.  
> Occasionally, parts of the stomach can protrude up through the hiatus and become trapped or unable to return to its normal place.  This is known as an incarcerated hernia.  When the blood supply to the part of the stomach that is incarcerated is affected, the condition is called a strangulated hernia.  A strangulated hernia is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgery.

One of the  surgical procedures used to repair a hiatal hernia is called a Nissen fundoplication.  During this surgery, the stomach is put back into its natural place and the weakness in the hiatus is repaired with sutures.  To reduce acid reflux (backflow of acid into the esophagus), the upper part of the stomach is wrapped around the base of the esophagus.
> A Nissen fundoplication can be done through an incision in the abdomen or chest, or through a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a thin, flexible tube with a camera and light on the end.  When a laparoscope is used, the procedure is called minimally invasive surgery.  The method is determined by the size of the hernia and surgeon’s preference and experience. ","Hiatal hernias can be related to increased pressure in the abdominal cavity.  This can be caused by coughing, vomiting, straining during a bowel movement, sudden physical exertion, an inherited weakness in the muscular ring of the diaphragm (hiatus), pregnancy, obesity, increased fluid in the abdomen, tight clothing, and an injury to the abdomen.  Although most hiatal hernias don't cause symptoms, some people experience: 
> difficulty swallowing with upper abdominal discomfort or fullness 
> chest pain 
> heartburn 
> belching 
> regurgitation and acid reflux (backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus)
If a hiatal hernia causes chronic acid reflux, you may develop other serious conditions.  These can include inflammation and swelling of the esophagus, bleeding of the esophagus, pneumonia or asthma, and Barrett's esophagus (when chronic exposure to stomach acid causes the cells that line the esophagus to be more like those that line the stomach).  People who have Barrett's esophagus should be monitored for the development cancerous changes in the esophagus.  
> Severe hiatal hernias, which are less common, can cause obstruction, strangulation, perforation or hemorrhage.

If your hiatal hernia isn't causing symptoms, no treatment may be needed.  However, your doctor will still need to see you periodically.  When symptoms are present, they can often be treated with medication and lifestyle changes.  Be sure to follow your doctor's instructions for all OTC or prescription medications.  Lifestyle changes that may be recommended include:
> avoiding foods that may reduce the muscle tone of the lower part of the esophagus (chocolate, coffee, tea, cola, alcohol, peppermint, spearmint, and fried or fatty foods) 
> avoiding foods that may irritate the lining of your esophagus (citrus fruits, tomato products, pepper, and carbonated beverages)
> eating smaller meals during the day and avoiding eating for two to three hours before bedtime 
> eating slow to reduce air swallowing and burping 
> losing excess weight to reduce the pressure on your stomach. 
> avoiding vigorous exercise for two to three hours after you eat
> avoiding tight clothing that puts pressure on your stomach
> quitting smoking, if you smoke or use other tobacco products
> raising the head of your bed about 6 inches
> avoiding over-the-counter medications that can worsen your symptoms (such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin)

When you see your healthcare provider for evaluation, he or she will ask about your symptoms and perform a physical examination.  Though your doctor may decide to treat your symptoms first, he or she may also order some tests.  These tests can include pH testing (to see how much stomach acid is in your esophagus), esophageal manometric testing (to measure the difference in pressure between your stomach and your esophagus), an upper GI series (an x-ray of your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine), an upper endoscopy (direct visualization of your esophagus through a small tube), or other imaging studies.  Surgery may be recommended if your hernia is large, your stomach is in danger of strangulation, or the hernia causes chronic acid reflux and other problems that don't respond to conventional treatment.  If your healthcare provider recommends a hiatal hernia repair, prior to surgery tell him or her about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery.  These may include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners or aspirin
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery

> Don’t forget to make arrangements for transportation to and from the facility.","A hiatal hernia repair is generally safe and successful.  However, it may not eliminate all your symptoms or the need for heartburn medication.  Your symptoms may also return in the future.  
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and infection.  
> Risks specific to this type of surgery include bloating, pain and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), return of the hiatal hernia, lung problems (rare), and damage to the abdominal organs (very rare).  A second surgery may also be needed if a new hernia develops, the stomach was wrapped to tightly around the esophagus, or the wrap loosens.

If severe and untreated, they can lead to a blood clot in the vein, rectal ulcers, infection, severe pain, and the inability to control urination or bowel movements.  When the blood supply to a hemorrhoid is affected, it needs to be surgically removed because it can cause death of tissue (gangrene).
> Internal hemorrhoids develop in the lower rectum just above the anus. If an internal hemorrhoid protrudes through the anal opening, it's called a prolapsed hemorrhoid.  
> External hemorrhoids develop just outside the anus. 
A hemorrhoidectomy is the surgical removal of a hemorrhoid.  This can be done with a scalpel, scissors, electrical current, ultrasonic shears, laser, or a combination of techniques.  ","Hemorrhoids are caused by pressure within the veins in the rectal area that results in enlargement of the veins.  Factors that may contribute to hemorrhoids include: 
> straining to have a bowel movement or lifting heavy objects 
> pregnancy and childbirth 
> heredity
> aging and loss of muscle tone 
> chronic diarrhea or constipation 
> certain liver diseases 
> prolonged sitting 
> obesity 
> low-fiber diets 
> rectal surgery 

Some people who have hemorrhoids have no symptoms.  For others, symptoms may include a painful swelling or lump in the anal area; irritation and itching in the anal area; the feeling that bowel movements are incomplete; and bright red blood on toilet paper or stool.  Although rectal bleeding is often related to hemorrhoids, it can also signify colorectal cancer or another serious medical condition.  Contact your healthcare provider if you have rectal bleeding or other symptoms that are persistent.  He or she will take a medical history and perform a physical exam to find out whether your symptoms are due to hemorrhoids or other conditions.  To diagnose internal hemorrhoids, your healthcare provider may recommend: 
> a digital rectal exam
> an anoscopy (an exam of the anus and lower rectum using an instrument inserted into the anus) 
> a proctoscopy (using a small tube to see the internal part of the rectum) 
A sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy may also be recommended if you need a more complete exam of the colon to rule out a more serious condition.  

Treatment options for hemorrhoids vary depending on the location and severity of the hemorrhoids.  Most hemorrhoids can be treated with self-care treatments, over-the-counter medications, and/or minor procedures performed in the office.  Your healthcare provider may recommend a hemorrhoidectomy if your hemorrhoids are large, severely painful, or do not respond to more conservative treatments.  Prior to surgery, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements). Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery and get clear instructions on what you need to do.  These may include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.  

A hemorrhoidectomy is usually done in an operating room on an outpatient basis.  You may receive local, spinal (this numbs you from the waist down), or general anesthesia (this puts you into a deep sleep so that you are unable to see, hear, or feel anything).  After surgery, expect some pain and tenderness at the site.  Soaking in a warm bath can help.  
> You may be told to avoid heavy lifting, limit your activity for a few weeks, and avoid straining during a bowel movement or urination. Stool softeners are usually recommended.
> Complete recovery from a hemorrhoidectomy may take up to three to four weeks. Most people can resume normal daily activities in about a week.  
> Pain medication and help at home may be needed while you recover.
> Don’t forget to make arrangements for transportation to and from the facility.","A hemorrhoidectomy can decrease or relieve symptoms caused by a hemorrhoid.  As with any surgery, there are risks to be aware of and discuss with your surgeon.  
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the anesthesia, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and infection.  
> Risks specific to a hemorrhoidectomy include infection, bleeding, recurrence of hemorrhoids, difficulty urinating or having a bowel movement, and an anal stricture (a narrowing of the opening in the rectum). ","If your healthcare provider recommends a hemorrhoidectomy, ask the following questions.  
> What caused my hemorrhoids? 
> What treatment options do you recommend?  What are the risks to each treatment? 
> Can my hemorrhoids be treated by less invasive methods than surgery?
>What are the risks, if any, if I decide not to have surgery?

Abdominal hernias include umbilical hernias, which are located near the naval (belly button).

It may also be referred to as a spontaneous abortion.
> A miscarriage is most common during the first trimester (first 13 weeks) of a pregnancy.  Many miscarriages occur before a woman realizes she is pregnant. 
> A miscarriage can also be described as a complete abortion (no fetal tissue remains in the body), an incomplete abortion (some fetal tissue remains in the body), an inevitable abortion (a miscarriage will happen), an infected abortion (uterus and fetal tissue become infected), and a missed abortion (loss of fetus, but all fetal tissue remains in the body).
> It is estimated that between 10 and 20 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage.  The percentage drops once a heartbeat has been detected. ","Many miscarriages are related to an abnormally developed embryo that could not survive outside the womb.  The abnormal development is often due to chromosomal problems that are not inherited and will not necessarily occur again in later pregnancies. In fact, 60 to 70 percent of women who have a miscarriage for unexplained reasons go on to deliver healthy babies.  
> Maternal factors that may be associated with miscarriage include infections of the uterus, hormonal problems, uncontrolled diabetes, high blood pressure, problems with the immune system, blood clotting disorders, problems with the cervix, and defects in the structure of the uterus or cervix.  Exposure before birth to diethylstilbestrol (DES), a synthetic estrogen that was given to some women until the early 1970s, can also increase a women’s risk for having a miscarriage.  
> The risk of miscarriage may also increase if you use tobacco products or recreational drugs or alcohol.  
> Other factors that may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage include being underweight or overweight, exposure to certain chemicals, becoming pregnant within three months of having a baby or at an older age, or undergoing certain procedures during pregnancy (such as an amniocentesis). 

The most common symptoms of an impending miscarriage are vaginal bleeding, lower abdominal cramping, and a low back pain.  If you are spotting or bleeding, you should report the symptom to your doctor right away. Don't assume you are having a miscarriage; some pregnant women can experience a small amount of vaginal bleeding during the first trimester, without having a miscarriage.  If you do have a miscarriage, you may pass fetal tissue from your vagina.  If possible, save the tissue in a clean jar or sealable plastic bag so your doctor can send it for examination.  Your doctor will also want to make sure no tissue remains in your uterus. 
> You may continue to have vaginal spotting for one to two weeks after a miscarriage and your pregnancy test may be positive for 4 weeks.  
> You may experience very intense, but normal, feelings of grief and loss.  You may even have physical problems, such as loss of appetite, inability to sleep, or fatigue.  
> It is normal to be unsure of the best way to talk to your friends and loved ones about your miscarriage. To begin the healing process, it is important for you and your partner to share your feelings with someone who understands and can provide the support you need.  You may find it helpful to talk to your doctor, a counselor, or someone who has experienced a similar loss. 

After a miscarriage your healthcare provider may recommend surgery to clean out your uterus and prevent a serious infection or heavy blood loss.  This is called a dilatation and curettage (commonly referred to as a D and C).  During a D and C the lining of the uterus is scraped to remove any remaining fetal tissue.  To keep you comfortable and pain free, you will likely receive general anesthesia.  This is when you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.
> Antibiotics are sometimes prescribed after the procedure. 
> If you have Rh-negative blood, you will be given Rh immune globulin to help prevent Rh incompatibility with future pregnancies (unless the biological father is also Rh negative).  
Don’t forget to make arrangements for transportation to and from the facility and help at home while you recover.","Most miscarriages can't be avoided.  To ensure the best possible outcome for your pregnancy, get early and regular prenatal care, eat a well-balanced diet, limit your caffeine intake, avoid smoking or other tobacco products, and do not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs.  Take only medications your doctor has approved.
> If you are considering pregnancy and have a chronic illness, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, discuss your plans with your healthcare provider as such an illness should be under control before you start to try to conceive.  

If you have a D and C after a miscarriage, you will probably go home the day of your surgery. Make sure you follow the instructions of your healthcare provider.
> Strenuous activity, tampon use, douching, and sexual activity are typically restricted for a period of time after a D and C. 
> You may ovulate as early as two weeks after a miscarriage, so use contraception if you have intercourse.  
> If you want to get pregnant again, talk to your healthcare provider about time frames.  He or she may suggest having several normal menstrual cycles before trying to conceive. 

Some complications that are possible after a miscarriage and/or D and C include: 
> infection causing fever, chills, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, or abdominal cramping
> excessive bleeding (soaking one sanitary pad or more with blood within an hour) 
> rarely, internal blood-clotting problems that can lead to unexplained bruising or bleeding from other parts of your body

Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths that can grow on the inside of the uterus, within the wall of the uterus, or on the outside of the uterus.  
> Uterine fibroids can vary widely in size and the symptoms they cause.  Often, fibroids often cause no symptoms.
> Uterine fibroids are very common in women who still have their periods.  They tend to shrink after menopause, usually because their growth is no longer stimulated by the hormones that are present in women during the childbearing years.
> Some of the potential risks for developing uterine fibroids include being African American, being obese, having a family history of fibroids, not having had children, and having your period start earlier than is normal.

A myomectomy is a procedure to remove one or more fibroids from a women’s uterus; the uterus itself is not removed.  The procedure can be performed in several ways; this care path focuses on a myomectomy performed through an abdominal incision.  The incision can be in the lower abdomen along the bikini line (straight across or horizontal) or in the area of the belly button (straight down or vertical).  The type of procedure and incision depends on the size, number and location of the fibroids; the size and shape of the vagina; and the training of the surgeon.  
> In most cases, a woman can still have children after a myomectomy.  This makes this type of surgery a good option for women with severe symptoms, but who still want to have children.","The majority of uterine fibroids do not require surgical treatment.  However, surgery may be necessary if there is excessive vaginal bleeding, bleeding in between periods, severe cramps, and symptoms related to the pressure fibroids can place on the bladder or bowel.  Often, a course of non-surgical treatment is recommended before surgery. You should contact your healthcare provider if you have any of these symptoms.  He or she will perform a physical exam, including an internal exam (pelvic exam) to check  the uterus and other pelvic organs.  They may also order some tests, including:
> lab work, to see if you are anemic
> abdominal or vaginal ultrasounds, to evaluate your uterus and other pelvic organs
> a biopsy inside your uterus

Your healthcare provider may recommend removal of your uterine fibroids (a myomectomy) if the fibroids are causing severe symptoms that cannot be controlled with medication or other less non-surgical approaches..  Uterine fibroids often shrink after menopause begins, which makes monitoring them with periodic internal (pelvic) examinations an option for some women.

The hysteroscope is inserted into the vagina and is advanced through the cervix into the uterus.  After the uterus is examined, a laparoscopy, the use of small medical instruments and a camera inserted into 3 or 4 small cuts in the lower abdomen, may be needed to treat any endometrial tissue that is found outside the uterus.  
> A hysteroscopy and laparoscopy with removal of endometrial implants does not cure endometriosis.

> You and your healthcare provider should discuss why you need to have surgery and what alternative treatments might be available to you.

Prior to surgery, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery. These may include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners 
> regular medications you should take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.  

During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia is the most common type of anesthesia for a laparoscopy. With this type of anesthesia, you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
> Other types of anesthesia may be used during this surgery, but they are less common. 
> You may need pain medication and help at home while you recover.
> There may be a small amount of bloody vaginal discharge and cramping after the surgery.
> You should make arrangements to have someone drive you home after the surgery.","Endometriosis can lead to pain that interferes with day-to-day activities, cysts that can rupture, and difficulty getting pregnant.  The results after surgery are often very good and most women say their symptoms improve after surgery.  However, it is possible that symptomatic endometriosis will return and future treatment will be needed.
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and various infections.  Risks specific to this type of surgery include infection, damage to the uterus or organs near the uterus, and internal scarring (adhesions).
","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having surgery for endometriosis?
> What is my diagnosis and reason for the surgery?  What non-surgical alternatives are available to me?
> What are the chances my symptoms will come back after surgery?
> Do I need to fast before the surgery and, if so, for how long?  Is there any other special preparation for the surgery?  (If so, get clear instructions on what you need to do.)  What kind of sedation will I have?  What are the possible side effects? 
> What are the possible complications, how will I feel after the surgery, and how will I have to modify my activity?  Don’t forget to make arrangements for transportation to and from the facility and for help at home.
Make a list of your questions/concerns/symptoms and medications (including over-the-counter).  Verify which medications you should take before the surgery.  
After your surgery, you should know what you had done, what medication was given, and what symptoms you should report to your healthcare provider. You should also understand all home care instructions (including medications and side effects) and follow-up plans.  Your gynecologist should also let your primary care physician know the details of your surgery and treatment plan.",58662,This is when the cells that normally line the inside of the uterus are found in other parts of the body outside the uterus.,Complex,Outpatient,Hospital,,Female,Women's Health,6179,N80.9,,,

The endometrium is the tissue that lines the uterus; it is shed from the female body every month during menstruation.  Abnormal uterine bleeding is any vaginal bleeding that is different from a normal menstrual pattern, such as bleeding or spotting after menopause.  There are different types of abnormal uterine bleeding, but the most common is menorrhagia (heavy or prolonged bleeding that occurs at normal intervals).  
> Although abnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age, it is most common when menses begins or when a women is approaching menopause.

An endometrial ablation is a surgical procedure that destroys the endometrium, which can eliminate or cause a marked reduction of vaginal bleeding (menstrual flow).  Endometrial ablation is performed using various forms of energy, including electricity, heated thermal balloons, different types of radiowaves, and cryotherapy (freezing cold).  Depending on the method used, an endometrial ablation can be performed in a doctor’s office or as an outpatient surgical procedure.  It is often performed with a hysteroscopy.  A hysteroscopy is an exam of the inside lining of the uterus using a thin, lighted tube with a camera on the end (hysteroscope).  
> The hysteroscope is inserted into the vagina and advanced through the cervix into the uterus. 
> After the uterus is examined, the endometrium is destroyed using the selected method.  The type of energy used is determined by your specific circumstances.  ","There are multiple causes of abnormal uterine bleeding.  Some of these causes are:
> pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications
> use of oral contraceptives or other birth control methods
> uterine or cervical infection, cancer, injury, or other disorders
> blood-clotting disorders and chronic diseases, such as diabetes or thyroid disorders
> recent injury or trauma to the cervix or uterus
> certain medications or herbal supplements
> hormonal factors
Some causes of abnormal uterine bleeding can be serious.  Therefore, you should contact your healthcare provider if you have vaginal bleeding that is different from your normal menstrual flow or occurs after menopause.  Your provider will ask about your symptoms and do a physical exam, which will include an examination of your pelvic area (internal exam).  They may also order lab work, a pap smear, and/or abdominal or vaginal ultrasound.  If a specific cause isn't found, abnormal uterine bleeding is generally thought to be due to hormonal factors.

Your healthcare provider may recommend a hysteroscopy and endometrial ablation to treat abnormal vaginal bleeding that has not been controlled with medication or other less invasive treatments.  A hysteroscopy will first be done to evaluate the lining of your uterus and determine where and how the ablation will be performed.  During the procedure, you will be lying on your back with your feet in stirrups (similar to the position for a pap smear or other vaginal exams). 
> Endometrial ablation is not recommended for women who want to get pregnant, have abnormal cells in their uterus, or have been diagnosed with endometrial cancer. It is also not recommended for women who have a pelvic infection, have an IUD in place, have had previous uterine surgeries, or have a large or irregularly shaped uterus.  In some cases, it may not be recommended for postmenopausal women.

Prior to the procedure, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before the procedure. These may include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners or aspirin
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.  

During an endometrial ablation and hysteroscopy, you will receive some type of anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia is the most common type of anesthesia for an endometrial ablation performed with a hysteroscopy in a hospital.  With this type of anesthesia, you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
> Other types of anesthesia may be used for different types of endometrial ablations.
> You may experience some discomfort when the hysteroscope is inserted and when your uterus is filled with water or gas.  A cervical anesthetic spray can help reduce the discomfort. 
There may be a small amount of bloody vaginal discharge and cramping after the procedure.
> You should make arrangements to have someone drive you home after the surgery.
> You may need pain medication and help at home while you recover.","For most women, an endometrial ablation results in improvement in their symptoms without serious complications.  However, you should be aware of the risks and talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have.  Some of the potential risks are:
> puncture of the cervix or uterus
> infection
> damage to the uterus or organs near the uterus
> excessive fluid absorption (if water is used to enlarge the uterus)
> excessive bleeding
The general surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and various infections.  The risk of complications may be higher if a second ablation is performed.  

When compared to a hysterectomy, an endometrial ablation is less expensive, has a shorter surgical and recovery time, and has fewer complications.  On the other hand, it is more expensive than medication, some women need a second procedure due to persistent symptoms, and women who are younger than age 45 may have a higher risk of treatment failure.
> An endometrial ablation is not suitable if future pregnancy is desired.  Although pregnancy is still possible, there is an increased risk of complications such as miscarriage, spontaneous preterm delivery, and heavy bleeding.  Therefore, contraception is necessary if you are sexually active.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having an endometrial ablation?
> What is my diagnosis and reason for the procedure?  What other alternatives are available to me?
> What are the chances my symptoms will come back after the procedure?

Two important muscle groups help hold urine in the bladder.  The urethral sphincter, a ring of muscle at the bottom of the urethra, and the pelvic floor muscles, a group of muscles that support the bladder.  
> When the urethral sphincter and pelvic floor muscles weaken, the bladder drops down and urinary incontinence can develop.  
> Stress urinary incontinence happens when a sneeze, cough, laugh, exercise, or any other activity puts pressure on the bladder and causes urine to leak.  It is the most common type of incontinence, particularly among women.  

A sling operation is a surgical procedure that involves using a strip of man-made material or human tissue to support the bladder and urethra.  It typically involves making one incision in the abdomen and one small incision in the vagina.  
> The strip is inserted through the vagina. Then it is placed behind the spot where the urethra connects to the bottom of the bladder (called the bladder neck).  It is tightened and anchored into place through the incision in the abdomen.  The sling acts as a hammock for the bladder and helps keep the bladder and urethra in their correct position.  
> For a brief period after surgery, you may have a catheter in your bladder to drain your urine.","There are different causes of female stress urinary incontinence.  Some of these causes are:
> childbirth
> age and menopause
> obesity
> strenuous physical exercise
> certain medications
> a urethral muscle defect
Although not as common, men can also develop stress urinary incontinence from trauma or after having certain types of surgery or radiation. 
Before any treatment is done, any form of urinary incontinence requires a thorough evaluation to make sure all causes are identified.  It is not unusual for there to be more than one cause contributing to incontinence.

There are several different forms of treatment for stress urinary incontinence.  
> Conservative treatment can often be very successful.  These include muscle-strengthening exercises (Kegel exercises), vaginal cones, biofeedback, electrical stimulation, bladder training, and dietary changes.  If you are overweight, losing excess pounds can also help.  
> Some medications may be recommended to help with stress urinary incontinence, but they are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that use.  Talk with your healthcare provider for more information.
> There are several different devices and surgeries that are used to treat stress urinary incontinence that has not responded to more conservative treatments.  This care path includes information and costs for the surgical insertion of a bladder sling to support the bladder and urethra.  

Contact your healthcare provider if you have urinary incontinence that has not been controlled with conservative treatments.  He or she will ask about your symptoms and do a physical examination. The examination will include your pelvic area (internal examination) to check the shape and position of your bladder.  Your provider may also order laboratory tests, a urinalysis, and other diagnostic bladder tests to evaluate your urinary system.  You may also be asked to keep a voiding diary. 
> Depending on the circumstances, you may be referred to a urologist or urogynecologist (a doctor who specializes in the urinary tract of women).

Your healthcare provider may recommend surgery if your symptoms have not been controlled with less invasive treatments.

> Each flu season is different and the viruses can affect people differently.
> The best way to prevent the flu is to get your flu vaccine every year!","The viruses that cause the flu can spread by coughing, sneezing, or touching an infected surface or object. Others can “catch” the virus if they breathe in the infected droplets or touch an infected surface, and then touch their nose or mouth. The first symptoms of the flu usually begin rapidly, typically 1 to 7 days after exposure.  They include: 
> cough
> fever and chills
> general body aches 
> dizziness
> flushed face
> headaches
> nausea and vomiting
> fatigue
Although most of these symptoms usually resolve in a week or so, the cough and fatigue can last for weeks.  
If you have flu symptoms, you should make sure you get plenty of rest and drink an adequate amount of fluids.  You can try running a cool mist humidifier to help keep mucus membranes moist and relieve a dry cough.  You should also avoid cigarette smoke and other respiratory irritants.  If your symptoms persist, your healthcare provider may recommend an over-the-counter medication (acetaminophen or ibuprofen).  If your healthcare provider determines that you or somebody who lives with you is at high risk for complications, they may prescribe antiviral medications early in the course of your illness.
> There is a test to determine if you have the flu. It is usually not necessary to do this test, but it may be done if your symptoms are unusual or your doctor must make a decision about what type of medication to prescribe.    
> Antibiotics are not effective against viruses. The overuse of antibiotics can result in bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics and expose people to side effects.  Your healthcare provider may recommend an antibiotic if you develop a secondary bacterial infection, such as pneumonia.
In order to decrease the spread of any virus, you should avoid others who have cold or flu symptoms, stay home if you have cold or flu symptoms, cover your mouth when you cough, avoid touching your face, and wash your hands frequently!  If you have the flu and you work in an environment that includes other people, you should stay home from work until you are well.
Here are some important things to remember when treating a child’s flu symptoms.
> Children and adolescents (age 18 years and under) should not receive aspirin products to treat flu symptoms.
> You should not give decongestants to a child under the age of 4.
> Over-the-counter cough and cold products have not been shown to be effective in young children.
> You should not give cough and cold products to a child unless directed by the child’s healthcare provider.
> Always read and follow the instructions on the product label.","Most people recover from the flu without complications.  However, the flu can lead to bacterial (secondary) infections.  People who are at high risk for complications include the very young, the very old, pregnant women, residents of chronic care facilities, and those with certain chronic medical conditions (weakened immune system, heart disease, lung disease, obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease).  Children and adolescents (age 18 years and under) who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy are also at high risk of complications due to the possibility of contracting Reye’s syndrome after the flu.  
The following people should speak with their doctor regarding a possible need for anti-viral treatment if they are exposed to, or have symptoms of, the flu:
> people with severe flu symptoms
> caregivers of children under the age of 5 
> caregivers of children with developmental disabilities
> people with chronic medical conditions

It has many parts including bones, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage.  
> Lubrication for the joint is provided by a liquid that is produced by the joints lining, also known as the synovium. 
> Knee injury or pain is very common due to the structure and constant stress on the knee.","Some of the signs of a knee injury include:

If you injure or have pain in your knee, it is important you treat it with some basic first aid.  This can help improve your symptoms and protect your knee from additional damage.  The common treatment for a knee injury is known as ""PRICE,"" which stands for Protect, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation.
> Protect your knee from further injury using a sleeve or brace. 
> Rest your knee.   Minor knee pain should only need a day or two of rest.  
> Ice your knee three or four times a day.  Do not use ice longer than 15 minutes at a time and do not apply ice directly to your skin.  People with diabetes or problems with their nerves or circulation should not use ice.
> Compression using a stretchable bandage can help decrease swelling.  When you wrap the bandage around your knee, make sure it is not too tight and does not decrease the circulation.  You also need to remove the bandage when you sleep.
> Elevate your knee above your heart.  This will help decrease the swelling in your knee joint.
Your healthcare provider may recommend over-the-counter medications to help with your pain.

The bacterium is found in small rodents and other mammals.  Ticks that feed on these animals may become infected and transmit the bacteria to other animals and people. 
> The small deer tick and the western black-legged tick are the only ticks that have been found to carry the bacteria.  The small size of these ticks means that many people are not aware that they have been bitten. The more common wood tick, which is four times larger than the deer tick, does not transmit Lyme disease. 
> Lyme disease is most common in children younger than age 15 and adults age 30 and older. 
> Lyme disease peaks in June and July, but is considered common from April to October. 
> Lyme disease is more common in some parts of the USA than in other parts of the USA.
> It is possible to contract Lyme disease more than once.","Lyme disease is not spread from person to person or through contact with an infected animal.  Transmission occurs when infected ticks attach themselves to people, often after they brush against the leaves and brush where the ticks are located.  Pets can also carry ticks into the home, where they can than attach to humans. 
> To get Lyme disease, it is believed that an infected tick must be attached to a host for 24 to 48 hours. 
> Symptoms usually begin in 7 to 14 days, but the incubation period can range from 3 to 32 days. 
> Ticks can spread other diseases, so a single tick bite can transmit more than one disease. 

The symptoms of Lyme disease typically develop in 3 stages.  
> First stage – Early symptoms may include a circular “bull’s-eye” rash at the site of the tick bite.  Other symptoms may include headache, fever, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes.  Sometimes there are no symptoms and sometimes they can come and go.  
> Second stage – General symptoms can develop three to five weeks after exposure.  A rash that is similar to the original rash may develop in other areas of the body.  This can be accompanied by fatigue, fever, chills, headache, facial palsy (loss of ability to move one side of the face), meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord), muscle and joint pain that can move from one place to another, and inflammation of  parts of the eye.
> Third stage – Late symptoms may develop months or years later, even if there were no earlier symptoms.  This stage is often characterized by intermittent joint pain and swelling, usually in the knees and other large joints.  There may also be problems with the heart and the central nervous system (memory loss, personality changes, fatigue, and sleep disturbance). 

Lyme disease can be difficult to diagnose because it can mimic other conditions and there is no uniformly reliable test to confirm the diagnosis.  Diagnosis is based on symptoms, history of a tick bite or exposure to tick-infested areas, and blood test results.  Lyme disease may be confirmed with blood tests to see if you have developed antibodies (i.e., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], immunofluorescence assay [IFA], and Western blot [WB] test).  
> Blood tests are often not reliable until later in the disease.  Many people who have Lyme disease test negative.  Also, people can test positive when they do not have the disease.  Because of these diagnostic challenges, doctors will often begin treatment for Lyme disease based on such factors as a person’s symptoms and the part of the country in which they are located.
> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends the ELISA or the IFA test be done first.  If the results are positive, then the WB is done.  The diagnosis of Lyme disease is more certain if the WB is also positive. 

If you have been bitten by a tick and have symptoms of Lyme disease, your healthcare provider will perform a physical examination and ask questions about your medical history.  If there is a high suspicion of Lyme disease, laboratory blood tests may be recommended.  
> Tick bites by themselves do not typically require antibiotic treatment.  The decision to treat with antibiotics is based on the circumstances and risks the tick bite presents.  If you've been bitten by a tick and have symptoms of Lyme disease, treatment may be started as soon as possible, even before testing is complete.
> In areas with a high incidence of Lyme disease, your healthcare provider may treat a suspected deer tick bite with a single dose of an antibiotic.  Close follow-up is needed to watch for any new symptoms that suggest Lyme disease since additional antibiotic treatment may be needed if Lyme disease actually develops.  
> Antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease is usually given orally for a period of 21 days.  In certain situations (e.g., when certain heart or neurological problems occur), treatment might be given intravenously or into a muscle and last as long as 28 days.  There is no evidence that longer treatment results in better outcomes.","If diagnosed early, most people respond well to antibiotics; repeat treatment is rarely needed.  If you receive treatment in the later stages of the disease, it is still likely that you will recover completely, but it may take longer than if you received earlier treatment.  Left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to varying degrees of permanent damage to the nervous system, the heart, and the joints (often involving the erosion of bone and cartilage).  To decrease your risk of developing Lyme disease, take measures to limit your exposure to disease carrying ticks.  
> Reduce the number of ticks around your home by clearing leaves and tall grass. 
> Avoid tick-infested areas, especially in the spring and summer months.  If you must be in areas where ticks are found, walk on the center of trails to avoid grass and brush. 
> Cover as much of your body as possible, tuck in your shirt and pant legs, and wear light-colored clothing so ticks can be spotted more easily. 
> Before going inside, check your hair, clothing, and pets for ticks.  Once inside, do a full body exam, including your scalp.  Shower to get rid of ticks that have not have attached to you.  
> Put your outdoor clothing in the dryer for 30 minutes to kill any undetected ticks.
> Use an insect repellent.  Check with your healthcare provider on the insect repellent that is best for you and your family. Also ask how you should apply it.

Prompt and complete tick removal can decrease your risk of contracting Lyme disease. 
> Grab the tick as close to its feeding parts as possible. Use tweezers or a finger protected with a rubber glove, tissue, or paper towel.  Pull it out with slow, steady, gentle pressure.  Older methods of tick removal (oil, petroleum jelly, a hot match, or alcohol) are not as effective and may make it impossible for the tick to release itself from your skin. 
> Be sure you remove the entire tick.  Don't crush or squeeze the tick as it may contain bacteria. 
> If there's any question regarding the type of tick involved, you may want to keep it in a covered jar or sealed plastic bag.  The characteristics of the tick may influence treatment choices. 
> If you don't need the tick for identification purposes, flush it down the toilet. 
After removing and disposing of the tick, wash your hands and the bite area with soap and water.","If you have been bitten by a tick and have symptoms of Lyme disease, contact your healthcare provider.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.  Write down the details of your tick bite.  If you saved the tick, put it in a closed container or zip lock bag and bring it with you to your appointment.   
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.

Normally, a clear fluid called aqueous humor flows into the eye and nourishes the tissues in the eye.  It drains out of the eye through a special drainage system called the trabecular meshwork. 
> Glaucoma is the buildup of the aqueous humor in the eye, usually due to problems with drainage.  As the fluid builds up, the pressure inside the eye increases.  This increased pressure can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss.  Other eye structures can also be damaged.  
> Once nerve cells are destroyed and vision is lost, the damage is permanent. 
There are many different types of glaucoma.  The four most common types are primary open-angle glaucoma (most common), angle-closure glaucoma (acute or chronic), secondary glaucoma (due to injury, inflammation, steroid use, or eye surgery), and congenital glaucoma (appears soon after birth).

A trabeculectomy is a type of surgical procedure that gives the fluid in the eye another way to drain.  It involves making a small incision in the sclera (white part of the eye) and removing a piece of the trabecular meshwork.  An opening may also be made in the iris (round structure that surrounds the pupil) so the fluid can drain out and form a small blister or “bleb.”  The blood vessels in the eye then absorb the fluid or “bleb.”  
> Prescription medications are used during surgery to prevent bleb failure, which can be caused by scarring that occurs as the wound heals.
> In certain cases, drainage implant surgery and placement of a special shunt may be recommended.  With this surgery, a drainage device and tiny tube (shunt) are inserted into the eye to provide a passageway for excess fluid.  As with a trabeculectomy, the fluid that drains out of the device is absorbed by the blood vessels in the eye.","What causes glaucoma to develop is unknown, but some risk factors include: 
> high pressure in the eye 
> a family history of glaucoma 
> being African American, Latino, Hispanic or Asian American, especially if over 40 
> diabetes or high blood pressure
> myopia (nearsightedness) 
> being older than age 60 
> use of certain medications called corticosteroids
> certain eye injuries 
> pseudoexfoliation syndrome (the buildup of a protein-like substance in the eye that can interfere with the drainage of fluid.) 

Glaucoma is diagnosed as part of an eye examination.  Eye drops may be given to enlarge your pupils so that the structures within the eye can be seen more clearly.  (Depending on the strength of the eye drops, you may experience blurry vision or light sensitivity for up to 24 hours.)  The eye doctor will then use an instrument to look into your eye, measure your eye pressure, and examine the optic nerve.  The eye doctor may also perform a test called a visual field examination and then may make treatment recommendations.  Although there is no cure, various types of medications can help prevent vision loss associated with glaucoma.  The medications work by reducing the pressure in the eye in one of two ways.  The medications either improve the way the eye's drainage system works or by decreasing the amount of aqueous fluid produced inside the eye. 
> If medication is not effective, laser surgery may help prevent damage to the optic nerve.  There are different types of eye surgeries to treat glaucoma.  These surgeries work in different ways by altering the trabecular meshwork to help fluid drain better, making an opening in the iris to let the aqueous fluid drain out, or by partially destroying the part of the eye that makes the aqueous fluid.  
This care path includes the costs for creating a hole in the sclera and placing a drainage device to allow excess aqueous fluid to drain from the eye.  

Surgery to treat glaucoma is typically done as an outpatient procedure in a hospital or ambulatory surgery center (ASC).  Prior to the surgery, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before and after the surgery.  These may include:
> medications you should not take before the procedure, such as blood thinners or aspirin
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the procedure
> any activity restrictions you should follow during your recovery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.

During the surgery, you will most likely be awake.  However, you will receive medication to keep you relaxed and eye drops to numb your eye.  After surgery, anti-inflammatory eye drops, antibiotics, and other medications may be given.  To protect the eye after the procedure, most people wear an eye patch for a few days.  Your doctor will want you to avoid showering, swimming, driving, or strenuous exercise for a short time.  
> You should make plans to have someone drive you home after the surgery.
> You may need to use several different eye drops before and after your surgery.  Make sure you understand all the instructions given to you by the eye doctor.","Periodic eye examinations, including measurement of the pressure inside the eye and visual field examinations, are the best way to diagnose glaucoma early and prevent vision loss.  The outcome after surgery to treat glaucoma is usually very good.  Specifically, trabeculectomy has a high success rate, a quick recovery, and little pain or discomfort.  Complications after glaucoma surgery are rare, but you should know the risks and discuss them with your healthcare provider.  
> Some of the complications that can occur include infection, bleeding, cataract formation, changes in pressure within the eye, and loss of vision.  
> Even after successful surgery, many people need to continue taking glaucoma medications.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having glaucoma surgery?
> What is my diagnosis (type of glaucoma) and reason for the surgery?  Do I have any permanent damage in my eye?  What, if any, are the alternatives to surgery?
> Is there any special preparation for the surgery?  (If so, get clear instructions on what you need to do.)  What kind of sedation will I have?  What are the possible side effects?
> What are the possible complications, how will I feel after the surgery, and how will I have to modify my activity?
> How many of these procedures have you performed?  What kind of complications have your other patients experienced?
Make a list of your questions/concerns/symptoms and medications (including over-the-counter).  After your surgery, you should know what you had done, what medication was given, and what symptoms you should report to your healthcare provider.  You should also understand all home care instructions (including eye drops, medications, and side effects) and follow-up plans.",66170,This procedure involves making an opening in the eye and inserting a tiny tube that allows fluid to drain out.

When the hormones aren’t working, a person may experience symptoms that include:
> feeling tired and/or weak
> problems with cold temperatures
> dry skin
> weight gain, even if they are not eating more

For this reason, kidney stones must be removed.  One way to remove them is to break them up using sound waves. This is called lithotripsy.  Lithotripsy uses sound waves to break up stones in the kidneys, bladder, or ureters (tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder).  The small pieces of stone are then passed out of the body in the urine.  Your healthcare provider may recommend a lithotripsy as an option for you.
> Not all kidney stones can be treated by lithotripsy.   
> The most common type of lithotripsy is called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).  During this procedure, shock waves are directed at the kidney stones from outside the body.","A lithotripsy can be done in a hospital or an ambulatory surgery center (ASC).  It usually takes about an hour.  During the procedure, you will lay on a soft cushion filled with water.  You will be given medication to keep you comfortable and an antibiotic to prevent infection.  You may feel some tapping and discomfort as the shock waves go through your body and break up the stones.  Your healthcare provider may need to place a tube in your kidney to drain out the urine and remove all the small pieces of stone.   
> In some cases you made need general anesthesia. This is when you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
> You should make plans to have someone drive you home after the procedure.
Prior to the procedure, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before and after the procedure. These may include:
> Medications you should not take before the procedure; including medications that make your blood harder to clot (warfarin or Coumadin, aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen).
> Regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure.
> How many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the procedure.
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.","In most cases, lithotripsy is safe and the outcome after the procedure is typically very good.  However, your outcome will depend on the type of stones you have, how big they are, and where they are located in your urinary tract.  
> Complications after a lithotripsy can include pieces of stone being left in the urinary tract, bleeding around the kidney, infection in the kidney, and kidney damage.  
> The general anesthesia risks include a reaction to the sedation and breathing problems.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a lithotripsy?
> What is my diagnosis and reason for the procedure?  
> Do I need to fast before the procedure and, if so, for how long?  Is there any other special preparation for the procedure?  (If so, get clear instructions on what you need to do.)  What kind of sedation will I have? What are the possible side effects?
> Ask about possible complications, how you will feel after the procedure, and how you will have to modify your activity. Don’t forget to make arrangements for transportation to and from the facility and help at home.
Make a list of your questions/concerns/symptoms and medications (including over-the-counter). Verify which medications you should take before the procedure.  
After your procedure, you should know what you had done, what medication was given, and what symptoms you should report to your healthcare provider.

These stones develop over time and can block the passages that carry urine away from the kidneys.  The movement of these stones can cause excruciating pain, bleeding, and other symptoms.  
> Some types of kidney stones include calcium stones (most common), cysteine stones, struvite stones, and uric acid stones.","Kidney stones generally develop over time and do not always cause symptoms.  However, symptoms can develop when the flow of urine is blocked, or when stones move within the ureter (a narrow tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder).  These symptoms include severe pain in the lower abdomen or one side of the back, blood in the urine, fever and chills, nausea, and vomiting.  The symptoms can start quickly when the stones move in the ureters and go away just as quickly if the stones are passed out in the urine or stop moving.  
> Not drinking enough fluids every day is one risk for developing kidney stones.

You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms consistent with kidney stones.  If your symptoms are severe, you may need to go to the emergency room or an urgent care facility.  They will perform a physical exam and may recommend some tests to determine the cause of your symptoms.  These tests may include blood tests, urine tests, CT scans, x-rays, or ultrasounds.  An intravenous pyelogram (IVP) may be helpful in special circumstances, but it is no longer considered a first line test because there are effective options, such as ultrasound, that involve less radiation exposure.  If it is determined that you have a kidney stone, treatment will depend on your symptoms and the chemical makeup of the stone.  
> Some kidney stones pass out of the body in the urine and do not require any specific treatment.  
> Two common treatments for kidney stones are medications to dissolve the stone or help flush it out of the body and lithotripsy, which uses shock waves to dissolve the stones.  
> Surgical removal of the stone or the insertion of a stent to keep the ureter open may be needed if the stone is too large to remove in a simpler way, is causing severe symptoms, or is completely blocking the flow of urine. ","In general, the outcome for someone with kidney stones is very good.  Although they can cause severe pain, stones can usually be removed without damage to the urinary tract.  However, if the cause is not  treated, kidney stones can occur again.
> Untreated kidney stones can lead to more kidney stones, total blockage of the urinary tract, damage to the kidney, and recurrent urinary tract infections.  For this reason, kidney stones must be removed, especially if they are causing symptoms.","If you believe you have kidney stones, you should see your healthcare provider.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.

A migraine headache is moderate to severe pain usually described as throbbing on one side of the head.  However, it can occur on both sides, too.  It usually lasts from 4 to 72 hours.  There may also be other symptoms with the headache such as:
> sensitivity to light or sound
> nausea and/or vomiting
> physical activity that  makes the pain worse.
Often individuals must stay in bed due to the disabling nature of the headache.","Migraines tend to run in families and are more common in women.  There are two types of migraines, those with an “aura” and those without.  An aura is a sensation before the headache starts and can include visual changes (i.e. flashing lights), food cravings, feeling high or low, increased or decreased activity, bloating, and excessive yawning. 
> Not all severe headaches are migraines; migraine refers to a specific type of headache, requiring specific preventive and treatment measures.
Sometimes there are triggers that may contribute to a migraine.  Triggers include:
> bright lights, strong odors, or loud noises
> emotional or physical stress
> missed meals
> lack of sleep or change in sleeping pattern
> weather changes
> hormonal changes in women
> certain types of foods
Some people may have more than one trigger.  It is important to understand your triggers.
Treatment for migraines will vary.  Some common treatments include:
> trigger identification and avoidance
> medications to help prevent a migraine
> “rescue” medications to be taken at the onset of the migraine
> pain medications (over-the-counter and prescription)
It is important to remember that overuse of some pain medications may lead to more headaches, as well as other chronic, long term issues.","Prevention plays an important role in migraine treatment.  Lifestyle changes include:
> avoiding triggers
> eating regular meals and avoiding some foods that act as triggers
> getting plenty of sleep
> regular exercise
It is important to call your doctor if your headache is different or not responding to current treatment.  Call 911 or go to the emergency room if your headache has a sudden onset; is much more severe than usual; or is associated with loss of speech, vision, or movement.","Make an appointment with your healthcare providers and include a headache diary with date and time of each headache, how long it lasts, other symptoms, any known triggers, and what is currently helping it.

The virus is spread by close contact with an infected person, especially with their saliva.  The length of time someone with mono is contagious varies, but it can be up to several months.  Therefore, you should avoid sharing eating utensils and direct contact if you have symptoms of mono or are recovering from mono.
> Although it can occur at any age, mono is typically seen in teenagers between the ages of 15 and 17 and is known as the “kissing disease,” although it may be spread by close contact other than kissing someone who has mono.
","The symptoms of mono usually begin gradually, starting with a headache, sore throat, and general fatigue and illness.  The symptoms gradually get worse and a white or yellow discharge can be seen on the tonsils, which are typically swollen and red.  People who have mono often feel very poorly.  Other symptoms can develop, including:
> fever
> loss of appetite 
> general body aches and discomfort
> enlarged lymph nodes (especially toward the back of the neck and underarms)
> enlarged spleen
> Occasionally people with mono develop symptoms that resemble hepatitis.  
A pink rash, that resembles the measles, can also develop.  This is more common if you are taking an antibiotic for a positive strep test.  (Antibiotics should only be given for a sore throat if you have a POSITIVE strep test.)

If you have symptoms of mono, your healthcare provider will most likely perform an in-office test for mono; a test called “antibody titer” may also be ordered to determine if this is a current or past infection.  The goal of treatment is to relieve the symptoms and allow the body time to heal; antiviral drugs are not helpful in treating mono and antibiotics are only needed if there is secondary bacterial infection.  There are some things you can do to relieve your symptoms and prevent complications of mono.  
> Make sure you drink an adequate amount of fluids. 
> Salt water gargling can help relieve a sore throat.
> Get plenty of rest.
> Take over-the-counter medications (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) to help reduce your pain or fever.   
It is important that you avoid any contact sports or activities that might put excess pressure on the spleen and cause it to rupture.  ","A full recovery from mono can take several months.  Although the fever usually resolves in about 10 days, it can take a month for swollen glands and swollen spleen to return to normal.  Extreme tiredness can take a few weeks to a few months to resolve.  Some of the complications of mono include:
> bacterial throat infections
> rash
> hemolytic anemia (red blood cells don’t survive as long as they normally do) 
> jaundice due to hepatitis
> swollen testicles 
> ruptured spleen, which can be life threatening
Nervous system complications are rare, but they can occur.  These may include Guillain-Barre syndrome, meningitis, seizures, facial paralysis.
","Make an appointment with your healthcare provider if you or your child have symptoms of mono.  It is important that you make sure all activity is kept at a minimum.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know the diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects). 
> If your healthcare provider wants you to take a medication, ask if an over-the-counter product is right for you.
> If your healthcare provider prescribes a medication for you, ask for a generic version. If your doctor thinks that a generic version is not right for you, ask for a medication on the lowest available tier of your Prescription Drug List (PDL).

M,MP001,Low Testosterone - Office Visit,Testosterone | Male Problems | Low T,https://client.myoptumhealth.com/myoptumhealth/guest/page.esync?view=prelogin.learn.learnLanding&command=DiseasesAndConditions&article=6fd5d666b1259110VgnVCM1000005220720a____#.U0geyAr1rPE.email,"Low testosterone is a condition in which the body’s testosterone level is below the normal range.  Testosterone is a hormone that is important for male growth and development, as well as the maintenance of some of the body’s important tissues and functions (e.g., bone and muscle mass, the production of red blood cells and sperm, and regulation of a man’s sex drive).  This care path focuses on low testosterone that occurs during adulthood.     
> Primary hypogonadism (low functioning of the genital organs) usually results from conditions directly affecting the testes, such as certain infections and genetic conditions.
> Secondary hypogonadism is a problem with the parts of the brain that send signals to the testes to make more testosterone.  Secondary hypogonadism can occur because of disorders involving the pituitary gland (the so-called master gland), various inflammatory diseases, HIV/AIDS, medications and, obesity.
","As men age, it is normal for their testosterone level to decrease.  However, this rarely causes symptoms.   How rapidly the levels go down, and the need for treatment, varies among men.  Most men have minimal or no symptoms, and need no treatment at all. Also, the degree of symptoms doesn’t always correlate well to the actual testosterone level.  As a result, some men may have low testosterone levels but no symptoms at all.  Some symptoms that can occur with a low testosterone level include: 
> erectile dysfunction and decreased interest in sexual activity
> infertility
> decrease in hair growth on the face and body
> gynecomastia (enlargement of male breast tissue)
> decrease in muscle mass
> emotional changes 
> fatigue and difficulty concentrating
> feeling hot (hot flashes)
A decrease in bone mass (osteopenia or osteoporosis) can also occur in men with low testosterone levels.  It is also very important to note that a man may have one or more of the symptoms above and the symptoms may have nothing to do with testosterone levels.

Contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms.  They will perform a physical examination and may recommend some blood tests to find out the cause.  These tests can include a testosterone level, which is usually best done first thing in the morning when levels are highest.  It is important to remember that not all men with low testosterone levels have symptoms and need treatment.  Also, many men with symptoms that frequently occur with low testosterone levels actually have normal levels when tested.  Two separate low blood testosterone levels are necessary to diagnose low testosterone. 
> Depending on your history and symptoms, other testing may be recommended.  

Treatment for low testosterone in adult men is usually provided to treat symptoms and typically involves hormone replacement therapy.  This can be done through an injection, a patch that is changed each night, a gel that you apply to your body (typically under the arms), a putty-like substance you place under your upper lip or inside your cheek, and pellets that are placed under the skin.","Lower testosterone levels occur normally in men age.  Typically, these lower levels do not produce symptoms.  Treatment with hormone replacement therapy is usually provided to improve symptoms; it may also help to increase sexual function and decrease the bone loss and loss of muscle strength that can occur with low testosterone levels.  However, hormone treatment does have significant risks.  Discuss these risks with your healthcare provider.  Some of the complications related to hormone replacement include:
> increasing non-cancerous prostate growths
> stimulating the growth of existing prostate cancer
> enlargement of male breasts
> decreased sperm production
> transfer of medication to others (more a problem with the gels that are applied to your body) resulting in testosterone side effects
There is also concern that testosterone therapy may increase the risk of having a heart attack.","If you have symptoms of low testosterone, you should see your healthcare provider.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.  
> Ask if your symptoms can be controlled with medications?  If so, are there Tier 1 or Tier 2 medications on my Prescription Drug List that I should take?  How long will I need to take these medications?  What are the side effects of my medications? 
> Since external testosterone treatment may involve risks to you, and to those who are close to you, ask about alternative treatment (including the alternative of not treating at all).
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects).",99213,This is a condition where a man’s testosterone level is below the normal range.

M,MS001,Multiple Sclerosis - Office Visit,MS,,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord).  It starts with patches of inflammation (plaque) that randomly develop in parts of the central nervous system.  This leads to the destruction of the protective coating of the nerves (myelin sheath) and inability of the nerves to properly send signals between the brain, spinal cord, and rest of the body.  
> MS is an autoimmune process, which means that the body reacts against its own tissue (in this case, the myelin sheath surrounding nerves.)
> MS can cause diminished or lost function in any area of the body that is served by the affected nerve fibers. 
> MS can appear at any age, but it often strikes younger people between the ages of 20 and 40.  
> The cause of MS is unclear, but it is likely that a combination of environmental and genetic factors play a role.  Some experts think MS may be caused by a virus or some environmental trigger. 
> MS occurs more often in women, Caucasians, and people who have a family history of the disease.  It is also more common in areas with a moderate climate (such as the Northern United States, Canada and Europe). ","In most cases, multiple sclerosis (MS) can be classified as one of four types.
> Relapsing-remitting – Symptom flare-ups are followed by periods when symptoms are less noticeable (remission) and the disease doesn't progress.  This is the most common type of MS and the most treatable. 
> Primary progressive – Symptoms steadily worsen as the disease progresses. This group of patients is very challenging to treat.
> Secondary progressive – When someone with relapsing-remitting MS develops a steady worsening of symptoms, with or without flare-ups.  About half the people who have relapsing-remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS within 10 years. 
> Progressive relapsing – When symptoms steadily worsen and are accompanied by clear flare-ups.  This is the rarest type of MS. 
Rarely, MS symptoms progress or worsen rapidly without remissions.  This is known as malignant MS.

The symptoms of MS can involve different parts of the body, vary in type and severity, and mimic other neurological diseases.  They may develop quickly and resolve rapidly, or last for a long time and get progressively worse. 
> Symptoms may include vision problems; chronic fatigue and fatigue after physical activity that improves with rest; moderate to severe pain; weakness in the arms or legs; numbness or prickling sensations that may come and go; tremors, muscle spasticity and trouble with coordination; speech problems; dizziness; impaired concentration or memory; confusion; depression; sexual dysfunction; and bowel or bladder problems.
> Bowel problems may include constipation and stool incontinence.  Bladder problems may include urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence, and increased risk of urinary tract infection. 
> Symptoms of MS often become worse when body heat increases, either through exercise or due to environmental factors.  Symptoms may also be triggered by fever or stress.
Contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms.  They will do a physical and neurological examination.

Because there is no single test to specifically confirm the diagnosis of MS, you may need a series of tests. These tests can also be used to rule out other conditions that mimic MS.  Some of the recommended tests include lab work, an MRI, a test that measures electrical responses in your brain, and a lumbar puncture.  If the examination and testing show you have MS, your specific treatment will depend on your symptoms and the type of MS you have.  Some things you can do to help you feel better and control your symptoms include eating a healthy diet, exercising as recommended by your healthcare provider, limiting stress, and avoiding overheating.  
Your healthcare provider may also recommend medications to help with your symptoms.  
> Steroids may be ordered to treat relapses, but are usually not recommended for long term-use due to their side effects.  They will not change the progression of MS, but may limit the length and severity of attacks or relapses. 
> Muscle relaxants or tranquilizers may help relieve spasticity in the legs, especially at night. 
> Over-the-counter pain relievers may help relieve muscle and back pain.  Narcotic pain medications may be prescribed in some cases.
> Anticonvulsant medications can help relieve facial pain and antidepressants may relieve nerve pain in other areas. Antidepressants or antianxiety medications can also reduce fatigue, pain and sexual dysfunction caused by depression.  An antiviral medication may be used to treat fatigue.
> Other medications can treat bladder spasms or incontinence. Catheterization is sometimes necessary. 
> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several other medications to reduce the frequency of MS relapses and slow the progression of the disease.  These are thought to work by altering the body’s immune response that causes MS.
Finally, electrical stimulation may be used to relieve pain in areas other than the back and face.","Most people living with MS can live a nearly normal life span.  There is no cure for MS, so the goal of treatment is to alleviate symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.  However, the symptoms can get worse and change character as time goes on.  This can result in the need for change in medication and additional treatments. 
> For some people, symptoms disappear without treatment.  For others, treatment can help relieve troublesome symptoms and help maintain quality of life.
> Treatment should involve a team approach with multiple healthcare providers.  This includes a doctor experienced in caring for people with MS; a physical therapist; and possibly a psychologist, psychiatrist or social worker.
> If you have frequent relapses, disability may become permanent.","If you have symptoms of multiple sclerosis, you should see your healthcare provider.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.

M,NC001,Nerve Conduction Studies,NCS | EMG | Muscle Electrical Activity | Myogram | Neuromuscular Disease | Muscle Wave Recording | Electromyogram,,"Nerve conduction studies (NCS) are tests that measure the speed and strength of electrical signals as they travel along a nerve.  They are frequently done along with an electromyogram (EMG) to help diagnose conditions involving the muscles and/or nerves.  An EMG measures the electrical activity in muscles.
> During an NCS, small electrode patches are placed on the skin.  These patches are put in different locations over the nerves that are being tested.  The tester will then send a mild electrical impulse to one of the patches to stimulate a nerve.  
> After the electrical impulse is received, the machine will measure how strong the nerve’s reaction is.  It will also test the time it took for an impulse to travel along the nerve.  
> A complete NCS includes the results of the test, the doctor's interpretation, and a written report.","Nerve conduction studies may be done in a doctor's office, a specialized lab, or hospital.  Although there is usually no special preparation for NCS, there are some things you should know.  
> Avoid using creams or lotions on the day of the test.  
> Let your healthcare provider know if you have a pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator.  

Your healthcare provider may recommend NCS to evaluate a variety of nerve and muscle diseases.  During the test you may feel the impulse used to stimulate the nerve.  The discomfort is usually minimal and brief, but how uncomfortable it is depends on the strength of the impulse.  There are no lasting or long-term effects.  
> Sometimes, an electromyography (EMG) is performed after NCS.  The EMG can cause minor soreness in the muscles testing and bruising for a day or so.  
> Abnormal results can indicate a condition affecting the function of the nerve.","NCS can be done to evaluate symptoms related to the nerves, such as numbness, tingling, weakness, and pain.  It can help your healthcare provider determine if your symptoms are due to problems with a nerve or the muscles it stimulates. 
> NCS are not always accurate because the test measures the best fibers in a nerve, which may react normally.  Therefore, normal results can occur even when some nerve damage is present.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having this test?

The sores are caused by one of the herpes simplex viruses, which most people were infected with at some point in their childhood.  After the initial infection, the virus remains inactive in some of the nerves on the face.  Periodically, the virus may become active again, at which time cold sores can develop.  
> It is not known exactly why the virus becomes active again, but some of the potential reasons include stress, hormonal changes (such as menstruation), exposure to the sun, and having a fever.   
> Cold sores are most commonly caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1).  However, they can be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), the virus that causes genital herpes.
","Cold sores due to a viral infection are contagious from the time the sores develop until they are crusted over.  The virus can be spread by sharing personal hygiene products or having close personal contact with an infected person.  People often have symptoms before the cold sores develop.  Some of these symptoms include itching, burning, or tingling of the lips and surrounding area; sore throat; fever; swollen glands; and difficulty swallowing.  
Cold sores usually last 1 to 2 weeks.  They can go away without treatment, but there are antiviral medications that can decrease the pain and help shorten the time you are ill.    Some other medications that may be recommended include over-the-counter pain medications and anti-viral ointments.  Here are some things you can do at home to help control the symptoms associated with cold sores.
> Use ice or a warm, moist cloth on the blisters.
> Keep the blisters on your lip clean using soap and water.
> Do not drink hot liquids or eat spicy, salty, or citrus foods.
> Rinse your mouth with salt water or cool water.
> Eat freeze-pops or popsicles.
Until the blisters have all dried and crusted over, infected people can spread the virus to others.  To prevent reoccurrences, or decrease the spreading of the virus that causes cold sores, there are some things you can do.  
> Keep your lips moist and protect them from the sun with a lip balm or sunscreen.
> Do not have direct contact with anyone who has cold sores and wash all contaminated items (utensils, towels, linens) in boiling water.  Do not share personal care items (lipstick, toothbrush).  
> Avoid intimate contact if you, or your partner, have a cold sore or other symptoms of a herpes infection.  
In general, people with a cold sore should avoid contact with anyone in a high-risk group; this includes infants, people with reddened or irritated skin (e.g., someone with eczema), and people with a weakened immune system due to medication or illness.  
","Cold sores usually resolve on their own, but they can recur.  Some of the complications of cold sores due to an oral herpes infection are recurrent blisters, spreading of the virus, and a secondary bacterial infection.
> Infection with a herpes virus can be serious if it occurs near your eye (possibly causing blindness) or you have a compromised immune system due to medication or illness (possibly causing widespread infection).   
You should contact your healthcare provider if the blisters are near your eye or you have a compromised immune system due to medication or illness.  You should also be evaluated if your cold sores are not gone in 2 weeks, get worse, or become severe.  
","If you contact your healthcare provider for evaluation of your cold sores, be prepared to discuss your symptoms, how long you’ve had them, and if you have had them before. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, understand your treatment plan (including possible alternatives), and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects or precautions).
> If your healthcare provider wants you to take a medication, ask if an over-the-counter product is right for you.
> If your healthcare provider prescribes a medication for you, ask for a generic version. If your doctor thinks that a generic version is not right for you, ask for a medication on the lowest available tier of your Prescription Drug List (PDL).

It is a small gland, about the size of a walnut, and is located just below the bladder next to the rectum.  The prostate gland surrounds the tube that carries urine from the bladder (urethra), so when the gland enlarges it can affect a man’s ability to urinate normally.  
> The prostate gland frequently becomes enlarged in men as they grow older. This enlargement may or may not cause symptoms. This enlargement is called benign prostatic hyperplasia or benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH).
","BPH is due to a noncancerous (benign) growth of the prostate gland.  It is very common in men over the age of 50, and its occurrence increases with age.  The exact cause of BPH is unknown, but it is felt that hormones are an important factor.  Also, men who have a family history of BPH appear to have an increased risk.  There may be no symptoms in the early stages of an enlarged prostate.  Some of the symptoms that can develop as the prostate enlarges include:
> difficulty starting urination or a urine flow that is slower than normal
> leaking of urine, especially after urinating
> having to strain to push urine out or difficulty emptying the bladder

You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of an enlarged prostate.  They will do a prostate exam (digital rectal exam) and possibly a blood test called a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test.  
< Digital rectal exams and PSA tests are only for screening and do not diagnose prostate cancer. If the results of these tests are abnormal, follow up testing is necessary. 
> Persons who are diagnosed with BPH may also have follow up PSA testing.  PSA levels may be elevated for a variety of reasons.  By itself, PSA testing cannot definitively determine whether the cause of symptoms is prostate cancer or BPH.  
> The American Urological Association (AUA) has developed a questionnaire called the American Urological Association Symptom Score Questionnaire.  The questionnaire scores a man’s symptoms of BPH in order to evaluate their severity.  The score can be used to help determine the best treatment option, and evaluate the response to treatment.

Treatment of an enlarged prostate generally starts with lifestyle changes to reduce mild symptoms; “watchful waiting” is an option for some men.  (Watchful waiting means a decision has been made to monitor  the symptoms of BPH, but not treat with medication.)  If the symptoms become more severe, medications or surgery may be needed.  The treatment choice, which should be discussed with your physician, is generally determined by your symptoms, your overall health, and your personal preferences.  Doctors and patients should engage in shared decision-making, evaluating the potential advantages, harms, and alternatives to each option.   Some simple measures you can take at home to ease your symptoms include:
> avoid liquids after dinner, especially those with caffeine or alcohol
> go to the bathroom when you feel the urge to urinate
> after you finish urinating, be sure your bladder is empty by trying to urinate a second time

Men with BPH should usually avoid taking decongestants (such as pseudoephedrine), antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine), or any medications that contain a decongestant or antihistamine.  Other medications may also make symptoms of BPH worse, so tell your doctor or pharmacist about your BPH before taking prescription or over-the-counter medications.","All of the symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate can affect a quality of a man’s life.  BPH can also lead to urinary tract infections,  inability to control one’s urine flow, and inability to urinate.    
> All of the treatments for BPH have side effects that can affect a man’s quality of life.  The medications used to treat BPH can cause retrograde (backward) ejaculation, decreased interest in sex, and inability to have or sustain an erection (erectile dysfunction or ED).  The surgeries to remove some or all of the prostate can result in an inability to control urine (incontinence), problems with having an erection (erectile dysfunction or ED), and narrowing of the urethra (where urine flows) because of scar tissue. 
> Surgery may be performed with a scalpel (knife), laser, or cold therapy (cryotherapy).  In addition, some surgeries may be performed in a urologist’s office, without the need for a hospital operating room.  Check with your healthcare provider about what options are available to you.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of an enlarged prostate.   Be prepared to discuss any symptoms you have and how long you’ve had them.  Healthcare providers do not always agree on whether men should have a screening PSA test done if they don’t have any symptoms.  If you are interested, check with your healthcare provider about the possible advantages, harms, and alternatives to screening when you have no symptoms.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should  understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects or precautions).
> If your healthcare provider prescribes a medication for you, ask for a generic version. If your doctor thinks that a generic version is not right for you, ask for a medication on the lowest available tier of your Prescription Drug List (PDL).
> If your health care provider wants to refer you to a urologist, ask what types of prostate treatments they offer, and whether or not those treatments can be performed in the office.

The scope is inserted into the opening of the urethra at the end of the penis.  A special tool will be inserted through the scope to cut away the prostate tissue.  
> There are other minimally invasive methods of destroying small amounts of prostate tissue.  These can be used as an alternative to a TURP to relieve symptoms of BPH.  Some of these procedures can be done in a physician office and involve the use of freezing, called cryosurgery, or heat to destroy the prostate tissue.   However, not all procedures are appropriate for all persons with BPH.","Benign prostatic enlargement is a noncancerous (benign) enlargement of the prostate gland.

Treatment of an enlarged prostate generally starts with lifestyle changes to reduce mild symptoms; “watchful waiting” is an option for some men.  (Watchful waiting means a decision has been made to observe  the symptoms of BPH, but not to treat unless symptoms become more severe.  In that event, medication may be prescribed for symptom relief.)  As the symptoms become more severe, surgery may be needed to relieve symptoms and  improve quality of life.  The treatment choice, which should be a process of shared decision-making between you and your doctor, is generally determined by your symptoms, your overall health, and your personal preferences.   Some simple measures you can take at home to ease your symptoms include:
> avoid liquids after dinner, especially those with caffeine or alcohol
> go to the bathroom when you feel the urge to urinate
> after you finish urinating, be sure your bladder is empty by trying to urinate a second time
> exercise as recommended by your healthcare provider.  
Men with BPH should usually avoid taking decongestants (such as pseudoephedrine), antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine), or any medications that contain a decongestant or antihistamine.  

Your healthcare provider may recommend a TURP if you have moderate to severe symptoms that are not well controlled with self-care and medication OR you have urinary retention, frequent urinary tract infections, repeated episodes of a large amount of blood in the urine, bladder stones, or kidney damage.  If your healthcare provider recommends a TURP or minimally invasive surgery, prior to the surgery you should tell them about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  You should also ask about specific instructions to follow before and after the surgery.  These may include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery from surgical procedures.

Minimally invasive surgery, which may be done in a physician office, may require sedation, but usually does not require anesthesia.  A TURP is generally performed in an operating room. During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia is the most common type of anesthesia for a TURP. With this type of anesthesia, you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
After the surgery a catheter is placed into the penis to drain urine from the bladder.  This will remain in place for a few days.
> It is normal for urine to be very bloody for several days after the surgery.  Large clots are also possible, so the catheter may need to be flushed continuously or every so often as needed.      
> You may need pain medication and help at home while you recover.","Although a TURP is an effective way to relieve urinary symptoms due to an enlarged prostate, it has a risk of  complications.  The outcome of the surgery depends on the size of the prostate, age, lifestyle (including smoking), and overall physical and mental health.  There are several significant risks that you should be aware of and discuss with your healthcare provider.  
> The general surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation, breathing problems, bleeding, blood clots, and various infections.  
> Risks specific to this type of surgery include infection, nerve damage that can lead to an inability to control urine (incontinence) and problems having an erection (erectile dysfunction), backward flow of semen (retrograde ejaculation), and narrowing of the urethra (where urine flows) because of scar tissue.  
> You should let your healthcare provider know if you have any signs of infection (fever, excessive pain, or discharge) or inability to urinate after the catheter is removed.  
> Minimally invasive procedures that destroy tissue through freezing or heat have fewer and milder complications.  However, these procedures may be associated with a recurrence of BPH symptoms. 
> Since BPH is an ongoing process, any type of surgery may eventually result in reoccurrence of symptoms of obstructed urinary flow.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having prostate surgery?
> What is my AUA symptom score and what does it mean?

There are five different types of psoriasis; they are erythrodermic, guttate, inverse, pustular, and plaque.  The most common type of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis.  Plaque psoriasis is a chronic condition characterized by skin that is red, thick, and covered with patchy areas that are silver or white in color.  The patches are called scales.  What causes psoriasis is not clear, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease (where the body attacks itself) that causes skin cells to reproduce too rapidly.  This results in a buildup of dead skin cells on the surface of the skin, causing the scales or patchy areas seen with plaque psoriasis.  
> Although psoriasis can develop anywhere on the body, some areas where it is typically seen include the knees, elbows, and torso; the scalp and nails can also be affected. 
> The symptoms of psoriasis can vary from mild (a few small spots) to severe (patches that cover large areas of skin) and go away completely for long periods of time. 
> Some people with psoriasis develop a specific type of arthritis, known as “psoriatic arthritis.”  The symptoms associated with psoriatic arthritis can range from mild to severe and can affect different joints in the body.  Mild symptoms commonly affect the joints at the end of the toes and fingers; more severe symptoms can affect the spine, especially the lower (lumbar) spine area.  
","Psoriasis is not contagious and typically begins between 15 and 35 years of age.  You have an increased risk of developing psoriasis if other members of your family have it.  
The symptoms of psoriasis can vary a lot from time to time and can range from mild to severe.  Often the attacks are caused by a “trigger,” which can also make the psoriasis more difficult to treat.  Some common triggers include:
> a bacterial infection, especially those caused by streptococcus bacteria (i.e. strep throat)
> skin that is dry or being in air that is dry
> any type of skin injury
> excessive alcohol
> too little or too much sunlight
> stress
People with a weakened immune system due to medication or illness may have more severe symptoms than others.  
There is no cure for psoriasis, so treatment is focused on controlling the symptoms and preventing infection.  There are basically 3 types of medical treatment for psoriasis.  
> Lotions, creams, shampoos, and ointments that are applied to the affected skin.
> Prescription medications that target the immune system; these are given in the form of  injections that you can self-administer at home.
> Phototherapy, or the use of a special light to the affected areas.  
> Your healthcare provider may also order an antibiotic if you have a bacterial infection related to the psoriasis.
Some things you can do at home are taking daily showers, soaking in oatmeal baths, avoiding your known triggers, and exposing affected areas to limited sunlight (be sure to avoid sunburns).  Stress reduction techniques may be helpful, but their effectiveness is not well documented.  ","Psoriasis is a condition that may wax and wane over time; the flare-ups or attacks can vary depending on your circumstances.  Complications of psoriasis include a secondary bacterial infection and a specific type of arthritis (psoriatic arthritis).
> You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of psoriasis, your symptoms are severe or persist despite treatment, you have any joint pain or fever during your attacks, or you have a compromised immune system due to medication or illness.  
> If you have psoriasis and develop arthritis symptoms, you should discuss them with your dermatologist or rheumatologist.  
","When you contact your healthcare provider for evaluation of your psoriasis, be prepared to discuss your symptoms, how long you’ve had them, if you have had them before, and if they are progressing or changing. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, understand your treatment plan (including possible alternatives), and know about the medications that were recommended (including possible side effects or precautions).
> If your healthcare provider wants you to take a medication, ask if an over-the-counter product is right for you.
> If your healthcare provider prescribes a medication for you, ask for a medication on the lowest available tier of your Prescription Drug List (PDL).

This results in inflammation and damage of the tissues in and around the joints.  RA is a very different condition than the more common osteoarthritis.  It can be accompanied by other medical conditions caused by the same autoimmune reaction.  The inflammation associated with RA can cause significant pain, deformity, and disability.  Although the exact cause of RA is not known, risk for developing the condition is increased by such factors as:
> age (risk increases with age)
> sex (females have an increased risk)
> genetics (presence of certain genetic markers)
If someone is at increased risk for RA (e.g., has certain genetic markers) then certain triggers, such as an infection, may trigger the development of the condition.
","The symptoms associated with RA can start at any age, but often begin in middle age.  They usually begin gradually in the same joints on both sides of the body and the hands and feet are the most commonly affected.  Other joints that may be involved include the wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, ankles and knees.   The symptoms can vary, but frequently include:  
> joint stiffness, especially in the morning or after periods of inactivity
> joint pain, tenderness, and swelling 
> feeling tired all the time
> loss of appetite
> mild fever 
As the disease progresses the following can develop:
> a cycle of recurrences (called flare-ups) and remissions (when symptoms are not as active)
> joint deformities and disability 
> rheumatoid nodules (lumps under the skin) found around the elbows and hands
> chronic anemia (a condition characterized by a reduced number of red blood cells in the blood stream that can lead to fatigue or make it worse.) 

Diagnosing RA early is important to delay and limit joint damage and other complications associated with the disorder.  Contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms.  He or she will take a medical history, perform a physical exam, order lab tests and, if you do have RA, probably refer you to a specialist (rheumatologist) for treatment.  To monitor the status of the disease, your healthcare provider may recommend x-rays to check your joints and additional blood tests to  monitor the status of inflammation in your body.
> There is no test that is completely accurate in diagnosing RA, but testing can be helpful in making the diagnosis.
> Since RA is a chronic disease, treatment is usually needed for extended periods of time, perhaps for your entire life.  Treatment plans usually include periods of rest and exercise, medications to decrease inflammation and control joint damage, physical therapy, and surgery (if severe deformities are present and other treatments have not been effective).  The good news is that, in recent years, new drugs have been developed that can control the inflammation and joint destruction much better than those that were available in the past, but these medications do have serious side effects that warrant close monitoring
> Self-care measures include stress reduction, eating a healthy diet, the use of heat or cold applications, and education on how to effective manage your RA symptoms, such as pain and fatigue.
","The outcome for people diagnoses with rheumatoid arthritis depends on how severe the symptoms are and how well the disease is controlled.  In time, other body systems can also be affected and lead to, among others:
> lung and heart problems 
> osteoporosis (loss of bone)
> eye problems (especially dry eyes)
> hepatitis (inflammation in the liver)
> ulcers of the skin
> depression and anxiety
In order to prevent these complications it is important that you follow your healthcare provider’s instructions and keep your RA symptoms under control.  The medications prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis can have significant side effects that may affect your recovery.  It is important to remember that treatment is usually prescribed when it is felt that the benefits will significantly outweigh the risks.

> being overweight
> having a joint injury or a birth defect of the joints

Osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease, is a form of arthritis that affects the entire joint. It especially affects the tough rubbery tissue that protects and cushions the bones (cartilage).  
> Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It is one of the leading causes of disability in older adults. ","Osteoarthritis most often develops in the hands, hips, knees, neck, and lower back.  The symptoms usually develop slowly, typically starting during middle age or later.  Symptoms may include: 
> pain in the affected joint(s)
> a ""grating"" sensation or a ""popping"" sound with joint motion 
> joint stiffness after activity or inactivity (such as in the morning or after sitting for a long time) > joint swelling, warmth, or tenderness that can come and go
> limited range of motion of affected joint(s)
Occasionally, the symptoms associated with osteoarthritis may vary with cycles of flare-ups and remissions (when symptoms are less noticeable).  Osteoarthritis symptoms can vary from day to day due to many factors, including activity levels and environmental factors (e.g., weather conditions).  Sudden flare-ups are much more typical of other arthritic conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis).

Diagnosing osteoarthritis can lead to interventions that can help delay and limit joint damage and other complications associated with the disorder.  Contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the above symptoms.  He or she will take a medical history, perform a physical exam, and possibly order imaging studies (x-ray or MRI) to check the condition of your joints.  Your healthcare provider may also recommend lab work to rule out other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Its function is to help you see the images that have passed through the eye’s cornea and lens.  The retina can become loose when the retina has a tear or hole in it.  This weakness allows eye fluids to leak out and force the retina away from the structures that support it.  Some other causes of a retinal detachment are injury, severe nearsightedness, diabetes that is not well controlled, previous surgery on the retina, and chronic swelling in the eye.
> A detached retina can lead to bleeding in the eye and impaired vision or blindness. Sudden loss of vision should be treated as an emergency.
> This care path is for the repair of a simple retinal detachment done in an eye doctor’s office.  If the detachment is severe, the repair may need to be done in an operating room. ","A detached retina can lead to permanent vision loss, so it is important it be evaluated quickly.  The urgency of the repair depends on the location and the level of the detachment.  Some of the symptoms of a detached retina include:
> flashes of light
> blurred vision
> moving spots or floaters in your vision
> shadows or blind spots in one eye
Your eye doctor will perform a number of special tests on your eyes to see the inside area and decide the best course of treatment for you.   If the detachment is not severe, the repair can be done in the office using a laser to close the hole or tear.  A “gas bubble” can then be placed in the eye to hold the retina in place.  
> Most detached retinas need to be repaired as soon as possible.  However, if your retina has been detached for a long time a repair may not be needed.    
> If the detachment is severe then more complex procedures, such as a scleral buckle or vitrectomy, will need to be performed in an operating room.","The outcome after the repair of a detached retina depends on the type of detachment, the severity of the detachment, and the time it took to get treatment after eye problems began.  
> A retinal detachment can lead to permanent vision loss.  Prompt treatment can restore, or minimize, the vision loss.      
Those at risk for retinal detachment include people with diabetes that is not well controlled, severe nearsightedness, chronic inflammation, a family history of a detached retina, and those who have had previous surgery on their retina.

> Tinea corporis is ringworm of the exposed areas of the body.
> Tinea pedis is ringworm of the feet.  It is also called “athlete’s foot.”
> Tinea cruris is ringworm of the groin.  It is also called “jock itch.”  
> Tinea capitis is ringworm of the scalp.  
Ringworm usually occurs in warm, moist places on the body.  The risk of catching ringworm increases if you sweat a lot; are wet for long periods; or you have an injury to your skin, scalp, or nails.
> Although children are more prone to ringworm, it can affect anyone.  
> More than one area of the body can be affected at the same time.  
","Ringworm is contagious.  You can catch it by direct contact or by touching a contaminated surface, such as a shoe, sock, shower floor, pool, comb, or unwashed clothing.  You can also catch ringworm from your pet if they have the fungus on their fur or skin; this usually results in the cat or dog having bald spots.  Preventive measures include keeping your skin and feet dry, shampooing regularly, not sharing personal care items or clothing, wearing sandals in public pools or showers, and not touching pets that have bald spots until they are treated by their vet.  The primary symptoms of ringworm may include:
> red, itchy, raised patches of skin that have well-defined edges and a light center
> blisters that can drain and then crust over
> thick and discolored toenails
> bald patches of the scalp  
Before you see a healthcare provider for your ringworm, there are some things you can try at home.  These include:  
> keeping your skin dry and clean
> using over-the-counter antifungal creams or powders
> wearing loose clothing that does not rub on the affected area
> frequently washing clothes and other items that come into contact with your skin
If your ringworm is in your scalp or beard, persists for more than 4 weeks, keeps getting worse, or keeps coming back, you should see a healthcare provider for evaluation and further treatment.  

","Ringworm usually responds well to self-care and over-the-counter medication.  However, you may need to take a prescription medication by mouth if it doesn’t.  If you have frequent reoccurrences, you may need to continue preventive measures after the infection has cleared.  
> Secondary bacterial infections of the skin are an uncommon but potential complication.  Sometimes these infections can be serious.  
","While ringworm can go away with self-care, there may be times you need to see a healthcare provider for further treatment.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you’ve had them.

The loud snoring associated with obstructive sleep apnea is the result of air trying to pass through the narrowed airway.
> When you sleep, all of the muscles in your body relax.  If you already have a narrow airway, it can partially or completely close when the muscles keeping it open are relaxed.  
> Some other causes of obstructive sleep apnea can include having certain jaw and airway shapes, a large neck or tongue, and being overweight.  Children with large adenoids and/or tonsils can also have obstructive sleep apnea.","The first signs of obstructive sleep apnea are often reported by family members, who find the person having periods of not breathing and loud snoring when sleeping.  The most common scenario is the person falls asleep and snores loudly.  The snoring gets louder until it is followed by a period of silence, when the person is not breathing.  This is followed by a loud gasp, as the person attempts to breathe again.  The cycle repeats itself during the night with more episodes occurring if the person sleeps on his or her back.  However, it is important to note that for many people the signs of sleep apnea may not be as obvious.
Obstructive sleep apnea can make a person feel like they have not slept well, causing them to feel tired during the day.  It can also lead to:
> excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)
> irritability, forgetfulness, and depression
> headaches
> hyperactivity
> swelling in the legs (if obstructive sleep apnea is severe)
You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea.  They will take a history of your symptoms and do a complete physical examination.  A sleep study, also called a polysomnogram, is the most common test to determine if you have a sleep disorder.  The test may also be done with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to assess the quality of your sleep while you wear a mask that delivers pressurized air to keep your airways open.  Both tests can be done overnight in a sleep laboratory, with a technician in attendance, or at home without an attendant using portable equipment. If your symptoms and general health permit, a home sleep test is substantially lower in cost and much more convenient.
Treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is aimed at keeping the airways open during sleep.  This includes:
> wearing a mask at night that delivers continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
> wearing a dental device at night that helps position the lower jaw
> avoiding nighttime alcohol and medications that make you sleepy 
> losing excess weight
Surgery may be recommended in severe cases.","The outcome for obstructive sleep apnea is good if the symptoms are well managed.  Some patients have a hard time sleeping with the CPAP machine, so adequate follow-up and support may be needed.  Untreated obstructive sleep apnea can lead to:
> problems associated with excessive daytime sleepiness 
> heart problems (an irregular heart rate or rhythm, heart failure, and high blood pressure)
> stroke  
Due to these risks, you should let your healthcare provider know if your symptoms get worse or do not get any better with treatment.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you, or your family, note that you have symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea.

The mites burrow under the skin and cause sores and intense itching.  
> The adult female burrows into the top layer of skin to lay eggs.  When the eggs hatch, the young mites live on the surface of the skin.  Once the females mature, they burrow under the skin to repeat the cycle. 
> Norwegian scabies, also known as crusted scabies, is a severe form of scabies in which thousands of mites are present. 
","Scabies spreads through direct (skin-to-skin) contact with an infected person; skin contact is usually needed because the mites don't fly or jump.  (The longer the contact, the more likely you are to catch scabies, even if you have good personal hygiene.)  A female mite can live on someone for 4 to 6 weeks.  The mites can live for 3 to 4 days off the body, so it is possible to catch scabies by contact with recently infected clothing or linens. 
> You are more likely to catch scabies if you live in a crowded environment. 
> You can spread the infection from the time you are infected (even if you do not have any symptoms) until you have completed your treatment. 
The symptoms of scabies, which are caused by an allergic reaction to the mite, include:
>  intense itching (especially at night or after a hot bath)
> a rash, often between the fingers but can occur anywhere
> thin, pencil-mark lines on the skin (burrows)
> small, itchy blisters or raised red skin, usually in a line 
Treatment for scabies includes a prescription skin lotion, such as permethrin.  The lotion is applied to the body after taking a bath.  It is left on for a few hours and then washed off.  To avoid potentially serious side effects, carefully follow your healthcare provider’s specific instructions. 
> Scabies is very contagious, so all household members are usually treated at the same time, even if they don’t have any symptoms.
> You should avoid skin-to-skin contact with anyone for 24 hours after your treatment. 
> Children should not return to school or daycare until they have completed the recommended treatment. 
> If there are a lot of mites, you may need take an oral medication called ivermectin or apply the lotion a second time.  
> Your healthcare provider may recommend an over-the-counter antihistamine, steroid cream, or calamine lotion to help with the itching.  
Because mites can live several days in clothing, towels and bedding, any items that have come into contact with infected skin (clothes, linens, and towels) should be washed in hot water and dried in the dryer on a high heat setting.  You should also thoroughly vacuum your home.  
> Clothing that can't be laundered should be stored in bags for several days to give the mites time to die. 
","As long as it is treated appropriately, the outlook is very good for people with scabies.  The itching caused by scabies is due to an allergic reaction to the mite, so it can last a few weeks after treatment is completed.  Some potential complications include: 
> a secondary skin infection due to scratching
> small itchy nodules that are a reddish brown color and can last for several months
","Make an appointment with your healthcare provider if you have been in close contact with someone that has scabies or you have symptoms of scabies.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.  You should also note if you have been in contact with someone that has scabies.  
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.  Ask if family members also need to be treated.

Once you have had chickenpox, the virus remains inactive on some of the nerves in your body.  When the virus becomes active many years later, the rash and other symptoms associated with shingles occurs.  
> It is not known exactly why the virus becomes active again, but some of the potential reasons include stress, age (> 60 years), having had chickenpox before the age of 1, and a weakened immune system.  
> Shingles is usually diagnosed by physical examination and medical history.  Tests are rarely needed.","Shingles can cause pain, burning, and tingling a few days before the development of itchy, fluid-filled blisters that eventually burst and crust over.  The rash is usually located on one side of body, typically from the spine to the chest or abdomen.  Sometimes, the rash can involve the face (eyes and mouth), ears, and genital area.  It usually takes about a week for all the blisters to burst and crust over.  Other possible symptoms include:
> pain in the abdomen
> fever and chills
> general ill feeling  
> headache
> joint pain and swollen glands
> difficulty with facial muscles, vision loss, and hearing loss (if a nerve in your face is affected)
You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of shingles.  There are antiviral medications that can help control the virus, shorten the time you are ill, and decrease pain and complications associated with the disease.  These medications are more effective if you take them before the rash develops, usually within 3 days of the initial symptoms.  Some other medications that may be recommended include steroids, pain medications, antihistamines, and creams containing capsaicin (a pepper extract).  
To help control the symptoms associated with shingles you can:
> use cool, wet compresses on the rash
> rest until any fever has resolved
> use oatmeal baths with lukewarm water
> use over-the-counter medications and topical lotions (calamine) as directed by your healthcare provider
Until the blisters have all dried and crusted over, infected people can spread the virus to anyone who has not had the chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine.  (People who have not had the chickenpox, or received the chickenpox vaccine, will lack immunity to the virus.)  As long as the blisters are oozing, people with shingles should avoid anyone who has impaired immunity and pregnant women who have not had chicken pox or the chicken pox vaccine.
> If you do visit your healthcare provider, be certain that they are informed that you may have shingles, so they can separate you from other patients.","Shingles usually improves in 2 to 3 weeks, but sometimes the pain in the area of the rash can last for long periods, over months or years.   This pain is called postherpetic neuralgia and it is due to the nerve damage caused by the virus.  Postherpetic neuralgia can be mild to severe and is more common in people over 60 years of age.  Some other complications of shingles include:
> additional episodes of shingles 
> secondary bacterial infections of the skin
> permanent loss of vision (if the eye is affected)
> permanent hearing loss (if the face is affected)
> a more generalized infection involving a larger area of the body
> other serious infections, especially in people with an impaired immune system
There is a vaccine to decrease the complications associated with shingles.  The vaccine is now recommended for adults over 60 years of age.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of shingles.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you’ve had them.

This will require evaluation by an ear, nose, and throat specialist.  One of the ways your healthcare provider can check for problems is a nasal endoscopy, which is an examination of the sinuses using a lighted scope inserted into the nose.  This is generally done in the office. Surgery is only indicated if other treatment has failed or there is a blockage in the nasal passage (a nasal polyp).  
> Some things that increase your risk of developing sinusitis include allergies, certain medical conditions (such as cystic fibrosis and a weak immune system), large adenoids, and smoking.

It typically lasts a week or longer and can cause you to feel like your ears are congested, painful, or that you can’t hear as well. A frequent stuffy nose, or one that happens at certain times of the year, may be related to allergies.
There are things you can do at home to help ease the discomfort of a stuffy nose. 
> Blow your nose into a clean tissue to clear any mucous. 
> Drink an adequate amount of fluids to help keep secretions loose, especially water or warm fluids.
> Use extra pillows under your head when you lie down. 
> Over-the-counter decongestants or antihistamines may shrink the swelling and dry up the mucus in your nose.  However, they shouldn’t be used longer than the instructions say.

The shoulder joint is a ball-and-socket joint that is made up of bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage.  The ball is the head of the top arm bone (humerus) and the socket is a part of the shoulder blade (scapula) that is called the glenoid.  On the outside edge of the socket there is a rim of cartilage called the labrum, which helps make the socket deeper and keep the humerus in place.  The humerus is also held in place by the rotator cuff, which is made of four muscles and tendons.  
> The shoulder is a complex joint that is made up of three separate joints (the glenohumeral joint, the acromioclavicular joint, and the sternoclavicular joint).  These three joints work together and allow for more range of motion than any other joint in the body.  
> The glenohumeral joint is what most people think of as ""the shoulder joint”.  Problems with the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints are most frequently associated with shoulder pain.
> The structure and functions of the shoulder make it prone to injury or pain. 
","Shoulder pain can be caused by an injury, such as a rotator cuff tear or tear in the labrum, or a more chronic (long-term) condition, such as a frozen shoulder (a painful shoulder that has limited movement), degenerative joint disease, or shoulder impingement (when bones in the shoulder put pressure on the surrounding tendons or bursa).  Risk factors for shoulder pain and/or injury include age (over 40 years of age) and participation in activities that require repetitive movements of the arm above the shoulder.  
> The tendons in the shoulder can become irritated and inflamed when they are repeatedly moved overhead in the same motion, such as when pitching baseballs, swimming, or lifting weights.  
> Over time this inflammation can lead to tears in the tendons, especially those in the rotator cuff.  

Here are some simple things you can try at home (conservative treatments) that are often effective in relieving shoulder pain.  
> Resting the affected arm and shoulder for a day or two.  
> Applying ice to the shoulder to reduce the inflammation and pain.  Do not use ice longer than 15 minutes at a time and do not apply ice directly to your skin.
> Your healthcare provider may recommend over-the-counter medications to help with your pain.  These can include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, or mild pain relievers that do not have anti-inflammatory effects, such as acetaminophen.  Sometimes, these medications can cause side effects and interfere with other medications you are taking, so you should ask your healthcare provider which one is right for you.
> Physical therapy may also be recommended, as well as exercises that you can do at home to help strengthen your shoulder and prevent future injury.

If your symptoms persist, your healthcare provider may recommend imaging studies (x-rays or MRI) or a steroid injection to reduce the inflammation.  Occasionally, surgery may be needed to repair or correct problems in the shoulder joint.","Most episodes of minor shoulder pain will resolve with conservative treatment.  However, the effectiveness of conservative treatment depends on:
> the type of injury, if any
> any chronic conditions within your shoulder
> your age and overall health
> your adherence to the treatment plan prescribed by your healthcare providers.  

You should contact your healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms.
> If you experience severe, sharp, or tearing pain.
> If your shoulder pain gets worse, or does not improve with conservative treatment. 
> Your shoulder pain is associated with a fever or other signs of infection. 
You can help prevent future episodes of shoulder pain, and possible shoulder injuries, by avoiding repetitive overhead movements and performing exercises that help strengthen your shoulder.","Contact your healthcare provider if you have shoulder pain that is not responding to a home program or your symptoms are severe.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you have had them. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.

> The shoulder joint is a ball-and-socket joint.  The ball is the head of the arm bone (humerus) and the socket is a part of the shoulder blade (scapula) that is called the glenoid.  On the outside edge of the socket there is a rim of cartilage called the labrum, which helps make the socket deeper and keep the humerus in place. There are several types of labral tears that can occur.  A tear in the uppermost portion of this cartilage is called a Superior Labrum Anterior and Posterior, or SLAP lesion.  It can cause shoulder pain with overhead activities, a feeling of instability in the shoulder, and a clicking or catching sensation in the shoulder. 
> A labrum repair can be performed during a shoulder arthroscopy.  However, not all torn labrums require surgery.  The decision on whether to have surgery depends on the many factors including the type and size of the tear, the degree of pain, the response to non-operative  treatment, age, activity level, degree of instability, and condition of the other structures in the shoulder.","A tear in the labrum can result in shoulder pain, instability and weakness, and problems using the shoulder joint properly.  Some labral tears may not cause significant shoulder complaints and may not require surgery.

Some other reasons surgery may be recommended include a complete/large tear of the cartilage, extreme weakness in the affected arm, and no improvement with non-surgical approaches such as physical therapy, exercises and medication. 

Prior to surgery, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery. These may include:
> medications you should not take before the surgery, such as blood thinners 
> regular medications you should take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before surgery
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your recovery.  

During your arthroscopy, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> General anesthesia, the most common type of anesthesia for a shoulder arthroscopy, is where you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
> Other types of anesthesia may also be used during this surgery. 
You will probably go home the day of your surgery and may have your arm in a sling for a few weeks.  You may be allowed to move your arm to help prevent stiffness and weakness.

The larynx is located in the top part of the airway (trachea) and holds the vocal cords, which are necessary for speech.  Laryngitis is most commonly caused by a viral infection and is commonly associated with the common cold.  Some other causes of laryngitis may include:
> gastroesophageal reflux disease
> allergies
> bacterial infection
> injury to the vocal cords (e.g., from overuse)
> respiratory irritants (including smoking)
Croup and epiglottitis are airway problems that occur in young children. Their symptoms occur suddenly and are more severe than those of laryngitis in adults.  Epiglottitis can be life-threatening.","The viruses and bacteria that cause laryngitis are usually spread from person to person.  To help prevent laryngitis:
> avoid close contact with people who have upper respiratory infections
> wash your hands frequently
> avoid irritants and overuse through prolonged shouting, etc.
Smoking is an irritant that can frequently lead to laryngitis and hoarseness.  In addition to decreasing your risk of developing throat tumors, quitting smoking can decrease your risk of developing laryngitis and hoarseness.  

Some of the symptoms that can occur with laryngitis, besides hoarseness or difficulty speaking, are from the infections that cause the condition.  These symptoms include fever, swollen glands in the neck, cough, and sore throat.  
> To treat your symptoms, you can try resting your voice, use over-the-counter medications pain relievers, gargle salt water, drink plenty of liquids, consume a soft diet, use cool mist humidifiers, and suck on hard candy or throat lozenges (for older children and adults).

The larynx is often called the voice box, because it contains the vocal cords that allow us to speak.  The procedure can be done in one of three ways.  
> An indirect laryngoscopy uses a small mirror and light to see the back of the throat.  By shining the light on the mirror, the examiner can see the back of the throat.  It is typically performed in a healthcare provider’s office.
> A fiberoptic laryngoscopy uses a small flexible tube placed through the nose into the throat.  This allows the examiner to see the larynx.  It is typically performed in a healthcare provider’s office.
> A direct laryngoscopy places a small rigid or flexible tube into the back of the throat.  This allows the examiner to see deeper in the throat and remove either a foreign object or a suspicious piece of tissue for biopsy.  This procedure is typically done as an outpatient in a hospital or ambulatory surgical center after you have been given general anesthesia, so you are asleep and pain-free. You will need to remain in the facility where the procedure was performed until you are awake and able to drink fluids. 
This care path includes information and the costs for a fiberoptic laryngoscopy performed in a healthcare provider’s office.
","Fiberoptic laryngoscopies may be recommended if you have persistent throat or voice box symptoms, such as:
> persistent hoarseness
> persistent change in the sound quality of your voice
> difficulty swallowing or feeling like something is stuck in your throat
> persistent pain in your ear or throat 
> a lump in your head or neck area, especially if you are a smoker or former smoker

There is no special preparation for a fiberoptic laryngoscopy.  Your healthcare provider will numb your throat or the inside of your nose prior to inserting the tube, but you should not need other medications.  
> During the procedure, you may feel pressure in your nose and the back of your throat.  Some people also feel like they are going to sneeze when the nose is the entry point for the procedure.  
> Indirect laryngoscopies are not usually done in children or people with a strong gag reflex.  They are better candidates for a fiberoptic laryngoscopy. ","A fiberoptic laryngoscopy can help diagnose irritation of the throat and vocal cords due to acid reflux (GERD), nodules or polyps on the larynx, thinning of the tissue in the larynx, and cancer.  The procedure is very safe, but there are risks you should discuss with your healthcare provider.  The risks depend on which type of laryngoscopy you have, but can include:
> sore throat
> bleeding (including nose bleed)
> spasms of the vocal cords that can lead to difficulty breathing
> sores in the mouth or throat
> injury to the lips or tongue  
During a direct laryngoscopy, there is an additional risk of a reaction to the anesthesia.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a laryngoscopy?

M,SZ001,Seizures - Inpatient,Epilepsy | Fits,,"Seizures occur when there is abnormal electrical activity in the brain that causes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           changes in movement, sensation, or level of consciousness.  Epilepsy is another name for a seizure disorder.  It is diagnosed when there have been at least two seizures not caused by a reversible condition, such as low blood sugar or alcohol withdrawal.   According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) “the epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness.”
> In some people the cause of epilepsy is known (e.g., head trauma, brain tumors, or congenital abnormalities), but in some people the cause cannot be identified (idiopathic epilepsy).  

There are many different types of seizures in adults and children, but they can generally be divided into generalized seizures and focal seizures (also known as partial or local seizures).  
> Focal seizures affect one side of the brain.  Sometimes the person remains conscious and experiences tastes, smells, sounds, flashing lights, a tingling sensation, or uncontrollable movement in an arm or leg.  They may sit motionless and appear to be staring off into space. 
> Generalized or convulsive seizures are more severe and affect both sides of the brain.  The person loses consciousness and may fall to the floor when the seizure begins.  The muscles will spasm, causing the person to thrash about with their arms and legs jerking uncontrollably.  Sometimes the person will lose control of their bladder and bowels.","It is often difficult to determine the exact cause of recurrent seizures (epilepsy).  Some possible causes include: 
> head trauma 
> various medical conditions, such as a stroke, brain tumor, AIDS, liver and kidney failure, thyroid disease, or infection in the brain 
> electrolyte imbalance or water intoxication 
> drug or alcohol use or withdrawal 
> poisoning from lead, mercury, strychnine, or insecticides 
> certain medications 
> eclampsia (serious condition that can develop during pregnancy) 
In addition, seizures are more common in younger children, older adults, and people who have a family history of seizures.  Children who have seizures do not typically have a brain disorder and a cause is often not found.  When a cause is present, seizures in children may be the result of fever, infection, head trauma, blood sugar that is to low or to high, lack of oxygen, poisoning (lead, mercury, strychnine, or insecticides), and an abnormal heart rhythm.

For someone who has a seizure disorder, seizures may be triggered by stress, missed anti-seizure medications, certain prescription or over-the-counter medications, alcohol withdrawal and drug use, lack of sleep, and menstruation.  Prior to a seizure, some people have an “aura,” indicating a seizure is going to happen.  An aura can be a variety of strange sensations, such as tingling, abnormal smells, flashing lights, or emotional changes.  If you believe you have had a seizure, or a family member or companion observed a possible seizure, you should contact your healthcare provider immediately.  He or she will do a physical examination and ask questions about your symptoms, including the duration of your seizures.  Obtaining information from family members who were present during a seizure may be helpful.  
> An electroencephalogram (EEG), which records brain waves using electrodes placed on the scalp, is the most common diagnostic test to evaluate seizures.  If possible, this test should be done within 24 hours of the first seizure. 
> If a brain tumor or cyst is suspected, you may need imaging studies such as a MRI or CT scan 
> Blood work also may be recommended to exclude possible causes of a seizure.  This blood work will also be helpful if the decision is made to start anticonvulsant medications. 

Most patients with a seizure disorder can be managed as an outpatient.  This care path includes the costs for inpatient evaluation and treatment of a seizure disorder.  Inpatient care may be needed if seizures are not well controlled or resulted in a severe injury.  An inpatient stay may also be necessary when someone requires prolonged observation with EEG monitoring.  This procedure is often done to make a diagnosis of seizures, determine how well the seizure disorder is controlled, and to determine the effect of treatment.","It's frightening to witness a generalized seizure, but there is rarely any permanent brain damage after a single seizure.  However, there are some complications that can occur during a seizure.  These include biting your tongue, inhaling fluid into your lungs, injuring yourself due to falling, or having a seizure while driving or operating machinery.  
> Status epilepticus is when there is a continuous seizure for a half hour or longer.  It can also occur when there are recurrent generalized seizures without the person becoming completely conscious between seizures.  The longer the seizure continues, the more difficult it is to control and the higher the risk of permanent brain damage.  
> Recurrent seizures can lead to difficulty learning and problems with self-esteem.  

Epilepsy usually can't be cured, but in most people the seizures can be controlled with treatment.  The first treatment for epilepsy is typically anticonvulsant medications.  The type of medication will depend on the type of seizures you have.  It is possible that changes in the type and amount of a medication, or a combination of medications, will be needed to control your seizures.
> Anticonvulsant medications can have side effects, so your doctor will monitor you closely. 
> Many of the medications to treat seizures can cause birth defects.  
> Anticonvulsant medication therapy may be discontinued if you have not had a seizure for several years.  If seizures recur, the same medication is generally restarted. 

Some other possible options for treating seizures that are not well-controlled by medication include surgery that eliminates the seizure focus (can result in a cure for some), vagus nerve stimulation, and ketogenic diet.  

Here are some things you should know if you are diagnosed with epilepsy.
> State laws vary on whether you can drive a car if you have a seizure disorder.  Check with the Division of Motor Vehicles department in your state for the law in your area. 
> Because of the risk of potential injury, your doctor may tell you to avoid certain activities (such as sports) until your seizures are under control for at least 3 to 6 months.","If you have had a seizure, you should see your healthcare provider.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.

The ball is the head of the femur, the large bone in the top of the leg.  The socket is the lower part of the pelvic bone, where the head of the femur sits.  A total hip replacement is when a surgeon replaces these two major parts of the hip joint with a man-made socket, ball, and stem.  This involves:
> removing the head of the femur, inserting a metal stem into the end of the bone, and attaching a ball to the head of the stem
> cleaning out the old hip socket by removing any cartilage and damaged bone and inserting a hip socket and liner in its place
There are times when only one part of the hip joint needs to be replaced; this is a partial hip replacement.","A total hip replacement may be recommended if the following are present: 
> severe arthritic pain that has not responded to treatment and stops you from doing your normal daily activities (walking, household tasks, and bathing)  
> a fracture of the femur (typically occurs in the elderly)
> an abnormal growth in the hip joint
In most cases, total hip replacements are performed in people over the age of 60. If a hip is replaced in a younger person, there is increased concern that it will not last the patient’s life. Prior to surgery, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements). Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery. These may include:
> medications you should not take before surgery; including medications that make your blood harder to clot (warfarin or Coumadin, aspirin, or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen)
> regular medications you should take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before surgery
> how to prepare your home for your return after you are discharged
> instructions on getting around with a cane, walker, or crutches.

> The temporomandibular joint connects the large bone of the jaw (the mandible) to the temporal bone of the skull.  Normally, the joint is flexible and moves smoothly up and down, allowing you to easily talk, chew, and yawn. 
> You can feel the temporomandibular joint move when you place your fingers in front of both ears and open your mouth. 
> Problems with the temporomandibular joint may occasionally result in biting or chewing difficulties, a clicking or grating sensation when chewing or opening the mouth, a dull/aching pain in the face, an earache or headache, jaw pain or tenderness, and a reduced ability to open or close the mouth.","Some benefit plans exclude coverage for services to diagnose and treat temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease, whether it is medical or dental in nature.  Please review your coverage documents and/or call the number on the back of your ID card for more information.  The estimates shown apply when the service is determined to be a covered service, eligible for in-network reimbursement.

The cause of TMJ disorders is unclear, but a variety of factors may be involved.  Some factors that may contribute to overwork, fatigue, or tension of the jaw and surrounding muscles are: 
> an injury to the jaw or overstretching of the jaw muscles during dental care or surgery 
> arthritis of the jaw joint
> clenching or grinding your teeth or biting your nails 
> poorly fitting dentures 
Researchers are not sure if emotional stress, anxiety, and depression are contributing factors to developing TMJ.  Research has also not shown that a bad bite, orthodontic treatment (braces and headgear), or chewing gum are involved in the development of TMJ.

TMJ symptoms are often temporary and go away on their own, with or without treatment.  Therefore, conservative treatment is appropriate for most people with TMJ.  This type of treatment emphasizes self-management measures, which include: 
> eating soft foods 
> gently massaging the area and doing exercises recommended by your healthcare provider
> applying a warm compress to the affected area 
> avoiding extreme movements such as wide yawning, loud singing, and gum chewing 
> avoiding habits such as teeth clenching and nail biting 
Your healthcare provider (doctor or dentist) may recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (ibuprofen or naproxen).  In some cases, physical therapy or an oral splint may be helpful.  In some cases, muscle relaxants or antianxiety medications may be used for a short time. 

Diagnosing TMJ disorders can be difficult because there is no specific diagnostic test available and symptoms similar to TMJ may be caused by other problems.  If you have symptoms of a TMJ disorder, see your healthcare provider.  He or she will take a medical history and perform a physical examination that focuses on your jaw.  He or she will also ask questions about previous dental issues, injuries, illnesses, stress, and habits (such as grinding your teeth or biting your nails).  
> Imaging studies may be recommended if conditions such as arthritis, a tumor, or a fracture are suspected.  They may also be recommended if you have significant, ongoing pain or lack of function that doesn't improve with conservative treatments. 
> Mouth splints, a common treatment for teeth grinding, may quiet the grinding.  However, they may not be effective at reducing pain or clenching.  Short-term use of splints may be helpful, but they can lose their effectiveness and can cause changes in your bite.
Dentists, oral surgeons, specially trained facial pain experts, or ENT (ear, nose, and throat) specialists may be helpful in treating TMJ disorders.","Although it can be difficult to diagnose TMJ disorders, once diagnosed, most people are able to be treated effectively with conservative measures.  Sometimes the symptoms even go away without treatment, although they can return again the future. 
> TMJ disorders can lead to limitations in the jaw joint's range of motion, persistent dislocation of the jaw, and secondary degenerative joint disease.
> Although conservative treatment typically provides temporary relief of pain and muscle spasms, it is not considered a cure.  If these measures are not effective, then you should talk with your healthcare provider about other treatments that may be helpful.
> Surgical treatments are often irreversible and should only be considered as a last resort.  
> Some irreversible treatments, such as surgical replacement of jaw joints, can lead to severe pain or permanent jaw damage.  In addition, some of these devices may not function properly or may break apart in the jaw over time.  
It is essential you get a second opinion before you have any surgery on your jaw. ","If you believe you may have a problem with your temporomandibular joint, you should see your healthcare provider or dentist.

The three parts replaced are the lower end of the femur, the large bone in the top of the leg; the upper end of the tibia, the larger bone in the bottom part of the leg; and the back side of the patella, also known as the kneecap. This involves:
> shaping the lower end of the femur and upper end of the tibia, so they fit the artificial pieces your surgeon has chosen
> connecting the two artificial pieces to the lower end of the femur and upper end of the tibia
> preparing the underside of the kneecap
> connecting the artificial pieces to the underside of the kneecap
There are times when only one part of the knee joint needs to be replaced; this is a partial knee replacement.","A total knee replacement may be recommended if you have severe arthritic pain that has not responded to treatment and stops you from doing your normal daily activities (walking, household tasks, and bathing).  
In most cases, total knee replacements are performed in people over the age of 60. If a knee is replaced in a younger person, there is increased concern that it will not last the patient’s life.  
Prior to surgery, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements). Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery. These may include:
> medications you should not take before surgery, including medications that make your blood harder to clot (warfarin or Coumadin, aspirin, or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen)
> regular medications you should take on the day of your surgery
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before surgery
> how to prepare your home for your return after you are discharged
> instructions on getting around with a cane, walker, or crutches
If you are a smoker, you should quit smoking, as it can interfere with your healing and recovery.  
During your surgery, you will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable and pain free. 
> general anesthesia, the most common type of anesthesia for a knee replacement, is where you are put into a deep sleep and are unable to see, hear, or feel anything.  
> other types of anesthesia may be used in certain circumstances. 
You will probably need to stay in the hospital for several days to recover from the surgery.
> Recovery can take many months and typically involves exercise and physical therapy.
> Pain medication and help at home may also be needed while you complete your recovery.","The outcome after this type of surgery is typically very good.  However, over time, it is possible that an artificial joint (prosthesis) will loosen and need to be replaced with more surgery.  
> The surgical risks include a reaction to the sedation; breathing problems; bleeding; blood clots; infection; injury to structures, nerves, and blood vessels in the area of the surgery; and heart attack or stroke.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a total knee replacement? 
> What is my diagnosis and reason for the surgery?   What non-surgical alternatives are available to me? How will the surgery affect my daily life?

Pregnant women and people who are very old, very young, or who have weak immune systems are at an increased risk of serious complications if they catch the flu. Serious complications can occur even in people who appear to be very healthy.  
> New flu vaccines are made each year to protect against the most current, active influenza viruses.  
> The flu vaccine can be given as a flu shot or nasal spray.  The nasal spray should not be given to people with asthma, certain other chronic diseases, pregnant women, or anyone under the age of 2 or over the age of 49.  
> Getting a flu vaccine every year is the best way to protect most people from getting the flu.
> People age 50 and older should also receive the pneumococcal vaccine to prevent certain types of pneumonia. It is NOT necessary to receive this shot every year.","The influenza vaccine typically becomes available during the fall.  However, immunizations given as late as March can still protect you from catching the flu late in the season.  Most people only need one flu shot each year.  However, children under the age of 9 may need two shots.  If your child is under 9, you should check with your healthcare provider to see if two injections are needed.  
> The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone over 6 months receive a flu vaccine UNLESS there are specific contraindications.  Some contraindications include a severe egg or chicken allergy, a fever or illness (not just a cold), a reaction to a previous flu vaccine, or the development of Guillain-Barre syndrome after receiving a previous flu vaccine.  
> Some groups of people are at an increased risk for complications if they get the flu.  Therefore, it is even more important these individuals receive the flu vaccine.  This includes pregnant women, children under age 5 (but over 6 months), contacts and caregivers of children under 6 months, healthcare workers and their immediate family, people with lung or heart disease, people with sickle cell anemia, people who live in chronic care facilities, contacts and caregivers of someone who is chronically ill, and people who are on long-term steroid medication.","Both flu vaccines are generally safe and effective.  The flu shot contains killed viruses.  Most people do not have significant side effects after receiving the flu shot, but the following can occur:
> soreness at the injection site 
> minor aches and pains
> low grade fever
> rare possibility of an allergic reaction
The nasal flu vaccine contains live, weakened flu viruses and is only recommended for healthy people between the ages of 2 and 49.  Pregnant women should not receive nasal flu vaccine.  Some potential side effects to the nasal flu vaccine include:
> fever
> headache
> runny nose
> wheezing
> vomiting
The viruses in either the flu shot or the nasal flu vaccine do not cause the flu.  The side effects of the nasal vaccine can seem like the flu, but they are not as severe or life-threatening as having the actual flu.","You should contact your healthcare provider if it is flu season and you have not received your annual flu vaccine.

Hepatitis B is a preventable viral infection of the liver, which can lead to liver disease that gets worse over time.  In some people who develop hepatitis B, their immune system is able to eliminate the virus and cure the disease.  In others, their immune system is not able to eliminate the virus (becomes chronic).  This can lead to serious long-term complications, such as scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) and liver cancer.  Hepatitis B is more likely to become a chronic condition if you are infected at an early age.
> Hepatitis B is caused by a virus (HBV) that infects the liver cell.  The HBV is found in the blood and other body fluids of infected people. 
> Thanks to immunization programs, hepatitis B infection can be prevented; the overall incidence of the infection has dropped.  
> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all children get their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and complete the vaccine series by 18 months of age.  Children and adolescents through 18 years of age who have not received the vaccine, as well as adults with risks factors for contracting the virus, should also be vaccinated.  ","The liver, a football sized organ on the upper right side of your abdomen, is essential for life.  It has many important functions that include storing nutrients, removing harmful substances from the blood, and producing important substances that enable the blood to clot and help with digestion.  The hepatitis B virus infects cells of the liver, which can lead to inflammation and a decrease in the liver’s ability to function properly.  Hepatitis B is spread through sexual, household, or occupational exposure to infected blood or body fluids (such as semen or vaginal fluid).  It can also spread through injection drug use or from an infected mother to her baby.  
> An infected person's blood, either fresh or dried, is highly contagious during the one to two months before and after symptoms appear.  The average incubation period is 90 days.
> People who develop antibodies and recover completely are not contagious.  However, those who develop chronic hepatitis B (infection lasts longer than six months) have the potential to spread the virus indefinitely. 
> Testing donated blood has greatly reduced the spread of hepatitis B through blood transfusions.  

You are at increased risk for hepatitis B if you: 
> are a man who has sex with men or 
> have had more than one sexual partner in the last six months 
> have recently been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease or have HIV 
> inject illegal drugs 
> are a long-term male prison inmate 
> are routinely exposed to human blood, blood products, or human bites 
> live or work in an institution for the developmentally disabled or provide care in other settings for people who have developmental disabilities  
> work in a facility that provides care to people at high risk for hepatitis B 
> live in, travel to, or emigrated from an area where hepatitis B is prevalent 
> are an unvaccinated adolescent 
> are a household member or a sexual contact of someone who's infected with hepatitis B
> have diabetes, chronic liver or kidney disease, or receive kidney dialysis 
> are the newborn of a mother who is infected with hepatitis B.  
All pregnant women should be tested for hepatitis B.  For people at increased risk, the recommendations of the CDC and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) differ slightly.  UnitedHealthcare follows the guidance of the USPSTF.

Hepatitis B can be acute (infection lasts less than sixty days) or chronic (infection lasts longer than sixty days).  Most children and about half of all adults who have acute hepatitis B have no symptoms.  When symptoms are present, they usually develop slowly and may include:
> jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) 
> fatigue and weakness 
> loss of appetite with nausea and vomiting 
> low-grade fever 
> dark-colored urine and light-colored stools 
> abdominal discomfort or pain 
> joint pain 
> rash 
> kidney problems 

People who develop chronic hepatitis B are known as carriers.  They often have no symptoms, but may have ongoing symptoms or periods when their symptoms suddenly worsen temporarily.  In some cases, the symptoms are actually due to complications of hepatitis B, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis (a chronic liver disease that may result in liver failure).  If you have symptoms of hepatitis B, your healthcare provider will do a physical examination and ask questions about your medical history and symptoms.  He or she will ask about potential exposure to hepatitis, blood transfusions, and sexual practices.  
> You may need several different blood tests to see if you have been infected with hepatitis B, how far the condition has progressed, and if you are a carrier.  The blood tests can also help your healthcare provider determine the best course of treatment for your condition. 
> Liver function laboratory blood tests may also be ordered to assess how well your liver is working.  

There is no specific treatment or cure for acute hepatitis B, but most adults recover completely within six months.  Some general treatment measures include getting plenty of rest, eating well, and taking only medications recommended by your healthcare provider (including prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal medications).  Your healthcare provider may prescribe medication if you have severe nausea and vomiting, an antiviral medication, or one of several medications to help boost your immune system.  In severe cases, hospitalization may be needed.  A liver transplant may be recommended if you develop liver failure.  
> There are treatment options for people with chronic hepatitis B.  The disease and treatment require office visits to monitor the disease and the effects of treatment. ","Most adults who have acute hepatitis B recover completely within six months.  Those who do not fully recover may develop serious complications and can infect others with the disease (become a carrier).  For adults, the risk of complications from hepatitis B is higher in people who continue to drink alcohol. It is also higher for those who are infected with another hepatitis virus, such as hepatitis A or C.  
> Hepatitis B can lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer.  In some cases, such as the development of a serious infection, hepatitis B may be fatal.  For carriers, complications may occur years later. 

If you've been exposed or possibly exposed to hepatitis B, notify your healthcare provider immediately.  He or she may recommend the hepatitis B vaccine or an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG, a protein that can act as an antibody). 
> Sometimes, both are given for added protection.  HBIG provides immediate protection until the vaccine can stimulate the body to produce its own protective antibodies.  They should be given as soon as possible after exposure to the virus, but preferably within 24 hours. 
> Whether you receive the vaccine or HBIG depends on factors such as your age; how you were exposed; and your health status, vaccination history, and degree of risk. 
If you develop chronic hepatitis B, you may need to see a healthcare provider who specializes in liver disease (gastroenterologist, hepatologist, or infectious disease specialist).","If you believe you may have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus, or have symptoms of hepatitis B, see your healthcare provider.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects). 
> Depending upon the results of your medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, your health care professional may refer you to a physician who specializes in the treatment of hepatitis B.
> If your healthcare provider prescribes a medication for you, ask for a generic version.  If your doctor thinks that a generic version is not right for you, ask for a medication on the lowest available tier of your Prescription Drug List (PDL).

Here are some questions to ask your healthcare provider.  
> Should my partner be tested? 
> What precautions can I take if I'm planning to get pregnant? 
> What hygiene precautions should I take to prevent exposure to others? 
> If I've been exposed to hepatitis B, should I receive immune globulin? 
> If I have hepatitis B, should I be vaccinated for hepatitis A? 
> If I've never had hepatitis B, should I receive the hepatitis B vaccine?  How will it protect me? 
> Is there a specific time period during which I should not have sex?  Should I limit my activity?
> Will I need follow-up blood tests after I feel better? 
> Do I need an evaluation by a physician who specializes in the treatment of hepatitis B?

It involves cutting and blocking the tubes that carry sperm (vas deferens).   This prevents sperm from leaving a man’s body and possibly resulting in a pregnancy.  The vas deferens can be cut through an incision in the scrotum, made by a scalpel, or through a puncture wound in the scrotum that doesn’t involve a scalpel incision.  After a vasectomy a man will continue to make semen, but because there should be no sperm present, pregnancy will usually not occur.  However, it is important to note that this is considered a permanent method of preventing pregnancy. Also, it should be noted that under very rare circumstances, a pregnancy may occur after a vasectomy.
> The testicles are two glands that are part of the male reproductive system.  They are located in the scrotum, a sack that sits behind the penis.  Their primary function is to produce sperm and testosterone (a male hormone.)
> The vas deferens allows the sperm to go from the testicles to the urethra, where they are eliminated from the body during sexual activity.  After a vasectomy, usually no sperm are able to leave the testicles and result in pregnancy. 
> Seminal fluid, which is released during ejaculation, is made in the prostate gland to nourish and carry the sperm.  The body will continue to make seminal fluid after a vasectomy, but the fluid will not contain any sperm. ","A vasectomy should be thought of as a permanent form of birth control.  Although in some cases the procedure can be reversed, the operation to do so is much more difficult and may not be successful.  Therefore, don’t consider a vasectomy unless you are sure you do not want to have children in the future.  
> Make sure you have discussed the procedure with your partner, if you have one at the time you are making your decision.   

In most cases, a vasectomy is done in a healthcare provider’s office.  It can also be done in an outpatient surgical facility.  The area will be cleaned, shaved, and numbed before the procedure.  Prior to the procedure, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over the counter medications and supplements). Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery. These may include:
> medications you should not take before the procedure, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the procedure
When you go the office, bring a scrotal support and wear comfortable clothing.  After the procedure you should wear the scrotal support for a few days.  You may also need to use ice and over-the-counter pain medication.","In most cases, a vasectomy is safe.  It will not prevent a man from having an erection or ejaculating.  It does not increase the risk of prostate or testicular cancer and will not stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.  
> Risks specific to this type of surgery include infection, pain and swelling.  You should let your healthcare provider know if you have any signs of infection (fever, excessive pain, or discharge).  
> Sperm may be present in the semen for a few months after a vasectomy.   An alternative method of birth control is necessary until no sperm is found in the semen.  
> In rare cases, the tubes can reattach and allow sperm to get into the semen again.  This could result in pregnancy.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a vasectomy?
> What are the pros and cons of the procedure?  
> Do I need to fast before the procedure and, if so, for how long?  Is there any other special preparation for the procedure?  (If so, get clear instructions on what you need to do.)  
> How soon can I resume sexual activity after the procedure?
Make a list of your questions/concerns/symptoms and medications (including over-the-counter). Verify which medications you should take before the procedure.  
> Ask about possible complications, how you will feel after the procedure, and how you will have to modify your activity. Don’t forget to make arrangements for transportation to and from the office and help at home if needed.  
After your procedure, you should know what you had done, what medication was given, and what symptoms you should report to your healthcare provider. You should also understand all home care instructions (including when you can participate in sexual activity) and follow-up plans (including post-procedure testing of semen).",55250,This procedure involves cutting and blocking the tubes that carry sperm.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) develops when the median nerve, which runs inside the carpal tunnel, becomes compressed or squeezed.  This pressure can lead to numbness, tingling, pain, and other symptoms in the hand and forearm. 
> An open carpal tunnel release involves making an incision in the palm of the hand and cutting the transverse carpal ligament.  This releases the pressure on the median nerve.  
> Endoscopic carpal tunnel release involves the surgeon making a tiny incision in your wrist and using a small tube with a camera to cut the transverse carpal ligament.  Although the recovery is faster with the endoscopic approach, there is a greater chance of nerve injury during an endoscopic release.  However, with a surgeon who has had lots of experience during endoscopic surgery, the risk is exceedingly small.
The costs associated with this care path are for an open carpal tunnel release.","CTS can be caused by any condition that causes increased pressure on the carpal tunnel and median nerve that runs within it.  Carpal tunnel syndrome can be related to a number of factors that can include: 
> having a smaller carpal tunnel 
> being a female (women have a higher risk) and being older
> inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or tendonitis 
> wrist joint injuries 
> noncancerous tumors of the wrist 
> thyroid disease, hyperactive pituitary, diabetes, and obesity 
> swelling related to conditions such as heart failure or pregnancy 
> occupations that involve repetitive motion of the hands and wrists
In some cases, no specific cause can be identified.

Contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of CTS.  They will ask about your health history, current symptoms, work activities, and hobbies.  A physical exam may include a variety of simple tests to determine the degree of median nerve irritation.  These tests include: 
> tapping the inside of your wrist 
> asking you to hold your wrist in a downward bent position for about a minute 
> gently pricking your hand or fingers and fingertips to determine sensation 
> checking for any loss of muscle strength and shape
 Your healthcare provider may also recommend electromyography, nerve conduction studies, imaging studies, and blood tests to determine if a specific condition is responsible for your symptoms.

The symptoms associated with CTS may resolve on their own, especially if you are young.  Initial treatment (also called conservative or non-surgical treatment) for mild to moderate symptoms of CTS includes:
> resting your affected wrist and hand and using the other hand when possible 
> avoiding activities that require repetitive twisting and turning of your wrist 
> elevating and icing your wrist
> wearing a splint
> physical therapy and cortisone injections may be recommend  
If an underlying illness such as diabetes or arthritis is causing your symptoms, treatment should first focus on the underlying illness, which can solve the problem.  

Your healthcare provider may recommend a carpal tunnel release if you have severe nerve involvement or your symptoms are severe, last longer than six months, or don't respond to conservative treatment.  Prior to the procedure, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over the counter medications and supplements). Ask about specific instructions you should follow before surgery. These may include:
> medications you should not take before the procedure, such as blood thinners
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the procedure
A carpal tunnel release is often done by an orthopedic surgeon in an outpatient facility with a local anesthetic to numb your wrist and hand.  Physical therapy after surgery is common to increase the strength and mobility of your wrist.","Early diagnosis and treatment of CTS can prevent permanent nerve damage and loss of muscle strength.  If you are at risk, it is important you do what you can to prevent CTS.  This includes: 
> losing excess weight
> adequately treating any disease(s) that increases your risk of carpal tunnel syndrome
> talking to your employer if you need any special equipment
> trying not to bend, extend, or twist your hands repetitively
> switch hands when possible
> do hand exercises periodically

In most cases, a carpal tunnel release is safe and symptoms typically improve after surgery.  There are rarely serious complications, but you should be aware of the risks and talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have.  Some of the potential risks are:
> infection
> nerve damage
> stiffness in the hand
Full recovery after carpal tunnel surgery typically takes a few months.  Let your healthcare provider know if you have any signs of infection or difficulty moving your hand.  ","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a carpal tunnel release?
> What is causing my condition and what are my treatment options?   
> What are the benefits and risks of each treatment option? 
> What can I do to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome or improve my symptoms?

> After the radioactive tracer is injected into a small tube placed into a vein, images are taken to track the flow of the tracer through the gallbladder, liver, and small intestine.
> Although a HIDA scan is usually done to evaluate the gallbladder, it can also be used to evaluate the liver and track the flow of bile from the liver to the small intestine. ","A HIDA scan may be recommended if you have symptoms of an acute gallbladder infection or blockage of a bile duct with gallstones.  It can be used to follow up on abnormalities that were found during a regular x-ray or ultrasound.  
> This test can help diagnose several diseases and conditions. These include inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), blockage of the bile duct, congenital abnormalities in the bile ducts, postoperative complications, and fistulas. 
> It can also be used to assess a patient after a liver transplant.
Not everybody with symptoms of gallbladder disease needs a HIDA scan.  It is useful when a healthcare professional strongly suspects gallbladder disease and earlier diagnostic tests do not reveal the source of the problem.

Prior to the procedure, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter medications and supplements).  Ask about specific instructions you should follow before the procedure.  These may include:
> medications you should not take before the procedure
> regular medications you should continue to take on the day of your procedure
> how many hours you should stop eating and drinking before the procedure","A HIDA scan does not usually have serious complications. Be aware of the risks and talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have.  Some of the potential risks are:
> reaction to the tracer that is used
> bruising
> rash","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a HIDA scan?
> What is my diagnosis and reason for the procedure?  
> What are the possible side effects?
> Are there any alternatives to this procedure?
> What are the possible risks/complications?
> How will I feel after the procedure? 
> What symptoms might indicate a problem after the procedure?
After your HIDA scan, your healthcare provider should provide a description of any problems found during the procedure and what symptoms you should report.  You should also understand all home care instructions (including medications and side effects) and follow-up plans.",78227,"This is a special test that uses a radioactive tracer to diagnose problems in the gallbladder, bile ducts, and liver.
