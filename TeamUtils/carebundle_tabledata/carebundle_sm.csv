M,AA001,Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm - Endovascular Repair,"An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a dilation (bulging) in a section of the wall of the abdominal part of the aorta (the main artery in your body).  It is generally defined as a bulging of one and a half times the normal diameter of the aorta or a diameter greater than or equal to 3 cm or 1.2 inches.  As the aorta continues to enlarge over time, the risk that a life threatening rupture causing massive bleeding could occur increases. There are two ways to repair an aortic aneurysm.
> An endovascular repair is a newer surgical procedure that is done through a small incision made in the groin.  A catheter (hollow tube) is inserted into the large artery in the groin  and threaded up to the aorta.  Using special x-rays, a collapsible tube (stent) is inserted into the aorta and expanded at the site of the aneurysm.  
> An open repair is a traditional surgery for repair of an AAA.  This surgery is done through a large incision made in the abdomen, usually from top to bottom (vertical incision).  A special graft (tube) is used to replace the weakened area of the aorta.  This surgery has been done for many years. The need for additional surgery is rare.  
> The size and shape of the aneurysm, as well as the condition of the arteries around the aneurysm, all determine whether a person is suitable for an endovascular repair.
This care path includes the costs for an endovascular repair.
","If you have any symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, make an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your options.  If you have symptoms of rupture of an AAA, as described above, you must seek medical attention immediately. 
 Ask your healthcare provider the following questions.  
> Am I at risk for developing an aneurysm?  How can I decrease my risk? 
> Do I have an aneurysm?  How large is it and what are my treatment options? 
> Can my symptoms be controlled with medications?  If so, are their Tier 1 or Tier 2 medications on my Prescription Drug List that I should take?
> Do I need any special tests?  What are the benefits and risks of having the tests?  
> Will the tests change your treatment recommendations?  If not, is there a need for them?
> What are the benefits and risks of an endovascular repair versus an open repair? 
> Is one type of surgery a better option over the other for me? Why or why not? 
> What symptoms are normal after the procedure? When should I be concerned? 
> How long after surgery should I follow-up with you?",34802,Complex,Inpatient,Hospital,Heart and Circulation,441.4,I71.4

This type of bronchitis usually occurs after a recent respiratory virus; bacterial infection (less common); or exposure to chemicals, dust or fumes.  
> Acute bronchitis is more common than chronic bronchitis, which is considered a form of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).  COPD is a condition that is most often the result of chronic smoking.  
> Acute bronchitis can also develop when stomach acids back up into the throat and damage the tissue.  This is called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD.
> Bronchitis often occurs after a cold and is most common in the winter.","Make an appointment with your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of bronchitis or a chest infection.

M,AB002,COPD - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease that interferes with breathing by destruction of lung tissue and/or the chronic blocking of airways due to inflammation and mucous.   Smoking is by far the most common cause of COPD.  However, there are also occupational causes of COPD.  In addition, one type of COPD is caused by a genetic disorder. 
> People with COPD may have emphysema (destruction of lung tissue, especially the walls of the air sacs in the lungs) and/or chronic bronchitis (inflammation of the air passages in the lungs that leads to increased amounts of mucous and a chronic cough).  Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, though many people have more of one of these conditions than the other.
> COPD is a progressive condition, meaning the blockage and destruction of the lung tissue increases with time, which leads to worsening symptoms.
","Make an appointment with your healthcare provider if you are at high risk or have symptoms of COPD.

M,AB003,Asthma,"Asthma is a lung condition that is characterized by swelling and narrowing of the airways, which interferes with the flow of air within the lungs.  This can lead to chest tightness, wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing (shortness of breath).  Asthma is a chronic condition, meaning the symptoms can continue over a long period of time, possibly throughout a person's life.  The symptoms can range from minimal and well controlled to severe.  Severe symptoms are frequently known as an �asthma attack.�  Asthma attacks are often caused by one or more triggers.  Some common triggers are:
> exposure to animal hair or dander in people who are allergic
> exposure to dust, mold, and pollen in people who are allergic
> exercise, particularly in cold weather
> weather changes (especially cold weather)
> exposure to various chemicals in the air or food, especially cigarette smoke

M,AC001,Acne,"Acne is the development of whiteheads, blackheads, or raised red spots on the skin.  These occur when the pores, or holes in the skin, become blocked with a plug made up of excessive oil, dirt, and bacteria.  If the top of the plug is white, it�s called a whitehead; if it is black, it�s called a blackhead.  Sometimes the plug opens, which allows the oil and bacteria to spread.  This can lead to additional redness and swelling.  If the plug goes deep into the skin, then painful, inflamed pockets (cysts) can form.
> Although it is more common in teenagers, acne can occur in infants and middle-aged adults.
","While acne can go away with self-care, there may be times you need to see a healthcare provider for further treatment.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you�ve had them.

M,AC002,Mole Removal,"Moles are small accumulations of  cells that produce melanin (the pigment that colors hair and skin).  Their color can vary from pink to varying shades of brown.  They are a common type of birthmark and frequently do not require any specific medical treatment.  However, some moles may be a form of  skin cancer. Even non-cancerous moles can sometimes cause problems, like bleeding or irritation if they are located on skin surfaces that rub against clothing.  
> Skin cancer refers to the growth of abnormal (malignant or cancerous) skin cells that can invade local tissues and sometimes spread to other parts of the body.  
> Moles may need to be removed if they  are changing in size or color, they bleed or become irritated or infected,  or there is an increased risk that they are cancerous.  

A skin biopsy to check for abnormal, or cancerous, cells is often done at the same time a mole is removed.  The biopsy can be done using various methods, depending on the type and size of the mole and area of the body involved.  The removal and biopsy of small moles can often be performed in a healthcare provider�s office, but in some cases they may need to be performed in an operating room.  
> Shave biopsy � The surgeon shaves off the top layer of skin.  No stitches are needed after this type of biopsy.
> Punch biopsy � The surgeon uses a sharp, hollow tube to remove a piece of a lesion.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the biopsy.  Depending on how much tissue is removed, sutures may or may not be needed.
> Excisional biopsy � The surgeon removes the entire lesion for testing.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the biopsy.  Sutures are usually needed; a skin graft may also be needed if the lesion is large.  
> Incisional biopsy � The surgeon removes a section of a lesion for testing.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the biopsy.  Depending on how much tissue is removed, sutures may or may not be needed.

For certain type of skin cancers, a type of excision called Mohs surgery is an option. This office-based procedure is done by a certain type of dermatologist who removes thin layers of the cancer and immediately examines them under a microscope.  This is repeated after each removal until the margins of the tissue removed are free of cancer. Mohs surgery, when appropriate, allows for complete removal of the skin cancer, particularly on the face, with an excellent result. ","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a mole removal and skin biopsy?
> What is my diagnosis and reason for the procedure?  
> What treatment options are best for me? 
> Do I need to see a dermatologist? Should I see dermatologist who performs Mohs surgery
> Should I see a plastic surgeon?
> Do I need to fast before the procedure and, if so, for how long?  Is there any other special preparation for the procedure?  (If so, get clear instructions on what you need to do.)
> What are the possible complications, how will I feel after the procedure, and how will I have to modify my activity?  Can I shower or bathe as I normally do?

Make a list of your questions/concerns/symptoms and medications (including over-the-counter). Verify which medications you should take before the procedure.  
After your procedure, you should know what you had done, what medication was given (if any), and what symptoms you should report to your healthcare provider. You should also understand all home care instructions (including medications and side effects) and follow-up plans.

M,AS002,Allergy Testing,"Allergy testing is done to determine if you are allergic to a specific substance (allergen). These may include insect bites, mold, pollen, latex, or animal dander.  This testing can also be done to find the possible cause of certain conditions (asthma, hay fever, and skin irritation).  Two methods of allergy testing are skin tests and blood tests.  
> Skin tests involve placing a small amount of a certain substance into the skin to see if redness and swelling develop.  This can be done by putting the substance on the skin and making a very small scratch with a lancet (prick test).  It can also be done by injecting the substance under the skin with a small needle (intradermal test).  Reactions are usually seen within 15 to 20 minutes. Skin testing is the primary form of allergy testing that is currently used.    
> If skin tests cannot be done, blood tests can help determine the cause of some allergies.  For example, your blood can be combined with particles of a potential allergen to see if there is a response (RAST test).

> A copper IUD is a plastic T-shaped device that has copper wire wrapped around the stem and arms.

A copper IUD can also be effectively used for emergency contraception if it is inserted within 5 days of unprotected sex.
> A levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is a plastic T-shaped device that releases the hormone levonorgestrel.  Levonorgestrel causes changes to the lining of the uterus and can prevent ovulation.  This provides further protection against pregnancy.  It is also effective in reducing bleeding and cramping during menstrual periods.  This type of IUD can be effective for 3 to 5 years, depending on the amount of hormones in the device.  
> Both the copper and levonorgestrel IUDs are more than 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy.","Make an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your birth control options.  If you decide to have an IUD inserted, ask your healthcare provider the following questions.

M,CR001,Biopsy - Breast,"A breast biopsy is the removal of a suspicious sample of breast tissue to check for the presence of abnormal, or cancerous, cells.  Your healthcare provider may recommend a breast biopsy to check for breast cancer if you have changes in your mammogram or breast exam.  Depending on the circumstances, a breast biopsy can be done in a healthcare provider�s office or operating room.  There are various methods that may use ultrasound, mammography, or other imaging techniques to help identify the area to be biopsied.  
> Needle biopsy � The surgeon removes tissue through a small needle (aspiration biopsy) or a hollow needle (punch biopsy).  Occasionally a vacuum-type device is used to pull out the breast tissue.  A needle biopsy is done through a small hole made in the skin, so there is less chance of infection or scarring; however, the results may not be as accurate because it is possible to miss cancerous cells.
> Incisional biopsy � The surgeon makes an incision and removes a piece of breast tissue for testing.  A medication is injected into the area to numb it prior to the biopsy.  Sutures are usually needed to close the incision.

M,CR002,Cancer - Breast - Mastectomy - Single,"Breast cancer refers to the growth of abnormal cells in the breast, often referred to as a malignant or cancerous tumor.  The breast is made up of lobules (glands that make milk), ducts (tubes that transport milk to the nipple), and stroma (tissue that surrounds and supports the ducts and lobules).  Although cancer can develop in any area of the breast, the two most common areas are the ducts (ductal carcinoma) and lobules (lobular carcinoma). 
> Breast cancer that is only present in its initial location, and has not spread to other areas of the breast, is called noninvasive or �in situ.�  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is cancer that has started in the milk ducts, but has not yet spread to tissues outside the duct.  DCIS can progress to invasive cancer if it is not treated.  Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is the presence of abnormal cells in the breast lobules.  These abnormal cells are not cancer, but their presence increases the risk of invasive cancer developing in the future.  LCIS is therefore considered a �marker� for the development of invasive cancer in either breast.
> Breast cancer that has spread from its initial location in the ducts or lobules to other areas of the breast is called invasive or infiltrating.  The two most common types of invasive breast cancer are infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) and infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC).  
> Estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) and progesterone receptor-positive (PR-positive) breast cancers are sensitive to specific hormones.  This means the hormones encourage the growth of the cancers and these cancers can be treated with medications that block the effects of estrogen.  If breast cancer is not sensitive to the female hormone estrogen, it is called estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative).  If breast cancer is not sensitive to progesterone, it is called progesterone receptor-negative (PR-negative).   
> Human Epidermal Factor Receptor 2-positive (HER2-positive) breast cancer indicates the presence of a gene that encourages the growth of breast cancer cells.  HER2-positive breast cancer tends to grow faster, be more invasive, and have an increased chance of returning.  Three new drugs that target this gene are available today and have been quite effective in reducing the risk associated with this form of breast cancer..  
> Triple negative breast cancer is cancer that is negative for both of the hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) and human epidermal factor receptor (HER2).  This type of breast cancer can often be more aggressive and challenging to treat than other types of breast cancer.  Therefore, the response to treatment and overall prognosis may be less favorable than cancers that are not triple negative.  
> In some cases, cancer cells block lymph vessels in the breast.  This blockage leads to a reddened, inflamed breast.  When this redness occurs, the condition is called inflammatory breast cancer.  Inflammatory breast cancer also tends to be an aggressive form of breast cancer that requires treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.

Breast Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the breast cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called �staging.�  Typically, breast cancer first spreads to the lymph glands under the arm. In advanced cases breast cancer can involve the bones, lung, liver, brain and other organs.
> Metastatic breast cancer is cancer that started in the breast and has spread to other organs.  
> In early cases of breast cancer (lumps smaller than 5 cm in size) it is usually not necessary to do additional imaging studies to check for other cancers because spread is quite rare.  
In order to decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific breast cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Does the breast cancer invade outside the milk ducts or is it limited to the inside of the milk ducts?
> How large is the primary cancer in the breast?
> Has the cancer spread to lymph glands under the arm or anywhere else in the body?
> Does the breast cancer have receptors for estrogen and progesterone? The presence of these hormone receptors suggest a less aggressive cancer.
> Does the cancer have large amounts of the HER2 gene?  

Breast Cancer Surgical Treatments
A mastectomy involves the surgical removal of varying amounts of breast tissue, usually after a diagnosis of breast cancer.  However, there are rare instances when a mastectomy is done for women with a very high risk of breast cancer to decrease their chances of developing breast cancer.  
> There are several types of mastectomies.  The type your healthcare provider recommends will depend on your specific circumstances and your personal preferences.  In addition to the factors listed above, you and the surgeon must also consider how large your breast is, your age, family history, and general health.  In most cases, women will have a choice between a lumpectomy and a modified radical mastectomy.  Your personal preferences will affect that choice.   
> If approximately one quarter of the breast is removed, the surgery is known as a lumpectomy or quadrantectomy .  Another name for this procedure is breast conserving surgery.  When breast conserving surgery is an option (e.g., for women with early stage breast cancer or smaller tumors) the cure rate is similar to that of a mastectomy.   However, this type of surgery usually requires radiation therapy to the breast after surgery. The decision is based on patient preference.
  > If the entire breast and lymph nodes from under the arm are removed, it is called a modified radical mastectomy.  This approach and the lumpectomy are the most common surgeries for breast cancer. 
There are other surgeries that are not commonly used for breast cancer.     
> If the entire breast is removed, but the nipple and area that surrounds it (areola) are left, it is called a subcutaneous mastectomy.  This procedure is not commonly done for breast cancer.
> If the entire breast, including the nipple and area that surrounds it (areola) is removed, it is called a simple or total mastectomy.  
> If the entire breast, lymph nodes from under the arm, and underlying chest muscle are removed, it is called a radical mastectomy.  This type of surgery is now  rarely used.  
After a mastectomy, a drain is usually placed to drain excess fluid and the incision is closed with sutures.  Reconstruction is optional and is a personal decision.  It can be done right after a mastectomy, a few months later, or not at all.

These abnormal cells are not cancer, but their presence increases the risk of invasive cancer developing in the future.  LCIS is therefore considered a �marker� for the development of invasive cancer in either breast.
> Breast cancer that has spread from its initial location in the ducts or lobules to other areas of the breast is called invasive or infiltrating.  The two most common types of invasive breast cancer are infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) and infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC).  
> Estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) and progesterone receptor-positive (PR-positive) breast cancers are sensitive to specific hormones.  This means the hormones encourage the growth of the cancers and these cancers can be treated with medications that block the effects of estrogen.  If breast cancer is not sensitive to the female hormone estrogen, it is called estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative).  If breast cancer is not sensitive to progesterone, it is called progesterone receptor-negative (PR-negative).   
> Human Epidermal Factor Receptor 2-positive (HER2-positive) breast cancer indicates the presence of a gene that encourages the growth of breast cancer cells.  HER2-positive breast cancer tends to grow faster, be more invasive, and have an increased chance of returning.  Three new drugs that target this gene are available today and have been quite effective in reducing the risk associated with this form of breast cancer..  
> Triple negative breast cancer is cancer that is negative for both of the hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) and human epidermal factor receptor (HER2).  This type of breast cancer can often be more aggressive and challenging to treat than other types of breast cancer.  Therefore, the response to treatment and overall prognosis may be less favorable than cancers that are not triple negative.  
> In some cases, cancer cells block lymph vessels in the breast.  This blockage leads to a reddened, inflamed breast.  When this redness occurs, the condition is called inflammatory breast cancer.  Inflammatory breast cancer also tends to be an aggressive form of breast cancer that requires treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.

Breast Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the breast cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called �staging.�  Typically, breast cancer first spreads to the lymph glands under the arm. In advanced cases breast cancer can involve the bones, lung, liver, brain and other organs.
> Metastatic breast cancer is cancer that started in the breast and has spread to other organs.  
> In early cases of breast cancer (lumps smaller than 5 cm in size) it is usually not necessary to do additional imaging studies to check for other cancers because spread is quite rare.  
In order to decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific breast cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Does the breast cancer invade outside the milk ducts or is it limited to the inside of the milk ducts?
> How large is the primary cancer in the breast?
> Has the cancer spread to lymph glands under the arm or anywhere else in the body?
> Does the breast cancer have receptors for estrogen and progesterone? The presence of these hormone receptors suggest a less aggressive cancer.
> Does the cancer have large amounts of the HER2 gene?  

Breast Cancer Non-Surgical Treatments
Radiation therapy involves the use of various forms of radiation, or high-energy x-ray beams, to kill cancer cells in a specific area of the body.  It can be used to cure a cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or as an alternative to surgery.  It can also be used to decrease symptoms that are related to a tumor.  Radiation can also be given before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery to prevent cancer from returning.  It may also be used to simply relieve symptoms of a progressive cancer.  It can be given simultaneously with chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy can be given in various ways, depending on what type of cancer you have and where it is located in your body.  
> Radiation therapy to treat breast cancer is usually given externally by a machine that is located outside the body.  The machine sends high energy x-ray beams to the tumor.  These beams can kill the cancer cells and result in a tumor that shrinks or even disappears.  These x-ray beams must pass through normal tissue on their way to the cancer and out of the body.  The radiation that passes through these normal organs can cause damage if the dosage is too high.  Radiation oncologists plan the treatments to minimize the amount of radiation exposure to normal organs.  The treatments must be given daily over several weeks because normal tissues don�t tolerate a large dosage given at one time. 
> Three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation uses a beam that goes straight through the body.  The patient�s position is changed so this beam comes through from two or three different angles.  The approach is planned to allow the maximum exposure of radiation to the tumor.
> Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses hundreds of angles to accomplish the same task.  It is far more expensive and is used when many angles are necessary.  This approach helps to spare an important organ that is not affected by the cancer.  In IMRT the intensity of the beam is varied to conform to the shape of the tumor. The aim is to limit damage to surrounding healthy tissues, while effectively treating the cancer.  IMRT is a valuable technique for treating a small percentage of cancerous tumors, but adds little value in the treatment of others.  IMRT may not be covered by your health plan unless certain criteria are met.  
> Brachytherapy applies the radiation source immediately next to the area being treated.  Most brachytherapy for breast cancer is given at the time of surgery.  Early studies suggested that this approach was as effective as external 3D conformal or IMRT and it did not require the additional weeks of therapy.  However, studies are now showing that the local recurrence rate of breast cancer may be higher with this approach.  
>  The decision to administer radiation therapy will depend on the type of surgery used for breast cancer.  A lumpectomy almost always requires an additional 4-6 weeks of radiation therapy to prevent any local recurrence of the breast cancer.  Depending on the tumor stage, patients with modified radical mastectomies may also require radiation therapy after their surgery.
> Radiation can also be given internally by placing special radioactive source near a tumor (called brachytherapy), orally in the form of a pill or capsule that is swallowed, or infusion of a radioactive substance into a vein.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of breast cancer.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you�ve had them. 
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.

M,CR005,Biopsy - Skin,"Skin cancer refers to the growth of abnormal (malignant or cancerous) skin cells.  Skin cancer can be described as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or melanoma; the specific type of skin cancer is determined by the type of cell affected.  Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are often lumped together in a category called, �non-melanoma skin cancer.�
> Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer.  Basal cells are found in the lowest level of skin.
> Squamous cell carcinoma is made of a squamous cells, which are flat and form the top layer of the epidermis (the outermost portion of the skin).
> Melanoma is the least common, but most serious form of skin cancer.  It forms in pigment cells found in the lower part of the epidermis.  These cells are the ones that usually give skin its color (melanocytes) and is the form of skin cancer that is most likely to spread and result in death.  

A skin biopsy is the removal of a lesion or area of skin to check for abnormal, or cancerous, cells.  A skin biopsy can be done using various methods, depending on the type, area, and size of the lesion.  Most biopsies can be performed in a healthcare provider�s office, but in certain circumstances may need to be performed in an operating room.  
> Shave biopsy � The surgeon shaves off the top layer of skin.  No stitches are needed after this type of biopsy.
> Punch biopsy � The surgeon uses a sharp, hollow tube to remove a piece of a lesion.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the biopsy.  Depending on how much tissue is removed, sutures may or may not be needed.
> Excisional biopsy � The surgeon removes the entire lesion for testing.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the biopsy.  Sutures are usually needed; a skin graft may also be needed if the lesion is large.  
> Incisional biopsy � The surgeon removes a section of a lesion for testing.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the biopsy.  Depending on how much tissue is removed, sutures may or may not be needed.

Lesions that have been determined to be cancerous are frequently removed using a complex procedure known as �Mohs technique.�  Mohs technique is when the surgeon removes cancerous skin cells one layer at a time.  A medication is injected into the lesion to numb the area prior to the procedure.  After each layer is removed, the tissue is immediately examined under a microscope to see if any cancer cells are present.  If cancer cells are seen, another layer of skin is removed and examined.  The steps continue until the microscopic examination does not reveal any cancer cells.  The wound is then either allowed to heal on its own or closed with sutures.  Your healthcare provider may recommend a skin biopsy and/or Mohs surgery if you have changes in your skin or a lesion (such as a mole) that appears suspicious or abnormal.  
> Mohs surgery is most often used in the removal of basal cell carcinomas.  
> The main advantage to the Mohs technique is that only diseased skin is removed from a specific area, saving as much normal skin as possible.  
> The Mohs technique allows the surgeon to get to the root of the cancer, which decreases the chance of it coming back.  
> Mohs surgery is usually performed in a healthcare provider�s office, but in certain circumstances may need to be performed in an operating room.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of skin cancer.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you�ve had them.

M,CR006,Biopsy - Cervix,"A cervical biopsy is the removal of a suspicious sample of the cervix to check for the presence of abnormal, or cancerous, cells.  The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb), where it opens into the vaginal canal.  Your healthcare provider may recommend a cervical biopsy to check for cervical cancer if you have an abnormal Pap smear or pelvic exam.  In some cases, a cervical biopsy can be done in a healthcare provider�s office; however, some need to be performed in an operating room with medication to help you relax.  The type of biopsy recommended by your healthcare provider will determine where it can be performed. 
> Colposcopy directed biopsy � This type of cervical biopsy may be done in a healthcare provider�s office.  A special microscope (colposcope) is used to examine the cervix and identify any abnormal areas.  A sample of the abnormal tissue is then removed using small forceps or a special needle.
> Cervical punch (cone) biopsy � This type of cervical biopsy is usually done in the hospital after you have been given some medication to help you relax or sleep (anesthesia).  During the procedure, a cone-shaped piece of the cervix is removed for examination under a microscope.  If all of the abnormal tissue is removed, this procedure can also be seen as a primary treatment that could get rid of all abnormal tissue.
> In most cases, a colposcopy is uncomfortable, but not painful.  When a sample is taken, you may feel a pinching feeling.  Having cramping and slight bleeding after the biopsy is common.
The costs for this care path are for a cone biopsy, performed in an outpatient facility. ","Contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of cervical cancer.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you�ve had them.

M,CR007,Cancer - Cervix - Hysterectomy,"Cervical cancer refers to the growth of abnormal (malignant or cancerous) cells on the cervix.  The female reproductive system has two ovaries, two fallopian tubes, and a uterus (womb).  The ovaries are where human eggs are made. The fallopian tubes provide a pathway for the eggs to travel from the ovaries to the uterus. The uterus is where a baby grows during pregnancy.  The cervix is the lower part of the uterus, where it opens into the vaginal canal.    
> Cervical cancer typically starts with cells that are not normal, but they are not yet cancerous (dysplasia). 
> If these abnormal cells are detected and destroyed early, before they become cancerous, future cervical cancer can be prevented.  Even when cervical cancer is present, when it is in its early stages, it is highly curable..  
> Most cases of cervical cancer are found in women who have not had routine Pap smears or have not had abnormal results evaluated and treated when they are discovered.  

Cervical Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the cervical cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called �staging.�  In advanced cases, cervical cancer can involve the bladder and other pelvic organs and tissues, lungs, and liver.
> Metastatic cervical cancer is cancer that started in the cervix and has spread to other organs.  
To decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific cervical cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  
> How large is the primary cancer in the cervix?
> Has the cancer spread to the nearby lymph glands or anywhere else in the body?
> Does the patient want to have children in the future?

Cervical Cancer Surgical Treatments
The main surgery to treat cervical cancer that has already spread outside the cervix is a hysterectomy.  An abdominal hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus through an incision in the lower abdomen.  The incision can be in the lower abdomen along the bikini line (straight across or horizontal). It can also be in the area of the belly button (straight down or vertical).  The type of incision is based on the reason for the surgery, previous surgeries, and patient preference.  
> The ovaries and fallopian tubes may or may not be removed at the same time as the uterus.  
> You and your healthcare provider should discuss what alternative treatments might be available to you, especially if you hope to have children in the future.
> If you need a hysterectomy, you and your doctor should discuss whether your ovaries and fallopian tubes should also be removed.  If you have not gone through menopause and your ovaries are removed, you may need to take hormone supplements to avoid the symptoms of early menopause and bone loss. 

There are other procedures that can destroy abnormal cervical cells before they have spread beyond the cervix. These procedures may be done without affecting a woman�s ability to have children in the future.  Three examples are:
> LEEP (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure), which uses an electrical probe to destroy abnormal cells
> Cryotherapy, which destroys abnormal cells by freezing them
> Laser therapy, which uses light to destroy abnormal tissue","Contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of cervical cancer.  Be prepared to discuss any symptoms you have and how long you�ve had them.

M,CR009,Cancer - Colon - Partial Removal of Intestines,"Colon cancer refers to the growth of abnormal cells in the large intestine or rectum, often referred to as a malignant or cancerous tumor.  The bowel is made up of the small intestine (where most of the nutrients are absorbed), the large intestine or colon (where most of the water is reabsorbed and stool is stored), and the rectum (where stool is stored until it is eliminated from the body).  The lining of the colon and rectum are where most colon cancers begin.  The development of a cancer usually begins with the formation of a polyp, a noncancerous piece of tissue that grows out from the lining of the bowel.  
> From its initial location in the bowel, colon cancer can spread or metastasize to lymph nodes and other organs or tissues. 
> There are blood tests to look for tumor markers that can help your healthcare provider monitor your status before, during, and after treatment.  These tests are called carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9.

A colectomy is the removal of varying amounts of the large intestine through an incision in the abdomen.  How much of the large intestine that is removed depends on your specific circumstances.  The factors that will determine the right procedure for you include the size of the tumor; where it is located; and your age, family history, and general health.    
> If the entire large intestine is removed, it is called a total colectomy.  
> If only a part of the large intestine is removed, it is called a subtotal colectomy.
> In some cases a colectomy can be done using small medical instruments and a camera inserted into 3 or 4 small cuts in the abdomen; this is called laparoscopic, or minimally invasive, surgery.  > Laparoscopic surgery allows for a quicker recovery with less pain and scarring than open surgery.

M,CR014,Cancer - Esophagus - Radiation,"Esophageal cancer refers to the growth of abnormal (malignant or cancerous) cells in the esophagus.  The esophagus is a tube that carries food from the mouth down to the stomach.  It is also known as the �food pipe.�  It contains muscles that move the food in one direction, from the mouth to the stomach, and help stop food from backing up into the throat and mouth (reflux).  
> Cancer of the esophagus is one of two types:  squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma.
> The cells that make up these two types of cancer look different when they are examined under a microscope.  

Esophagus Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the esophagus cancer to other areas of the body.  This process is called �staging.�  In advanced cases cancer of the esophagus can involve other organs.
> Metastatic esophageal cancer is cancer that started in the esophagus and has spread to other organs.  
In order to decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific esophageal cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Does the cancer invade outside the esophagus?
> How large is the primary cancer in the esophagus?
> Has the cancer spread anywhere else in the body?

Esophagus Cancer Non-Surgical Treatments
Radiation therapy involves the use of various forms of radiation, or high-energy x-ray beams, to kill cancer cells in a specific area of the body.  It can be used to cure a cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or as an alternative to surgery.  It can also be used to decrease symptoms that are related to a tumor.  Radiation can also be given before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery to prevent cancer from returning.  It may also be used to simply relieve symptoms of a progressive cancer.  It can be given simultaneously with chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy can be given in various ways, depending on what type of cancer you have and where it is located in your body.    
> Radiation therapy to treat esophageal cancer is usually given externally by a machine that is located outside the body.  The machine sends high energy x-ray beams to the tumor.  These beams can kill the cancer cells and result in a tumor that shrinks or even disappears.  These x-ray beams must pass through normal tissue on their way to the cancer and out of the body.  The radiation that passes through these normal organs can cause damage if the dosage is too high.  Radiation oncologists plan the treatments to minimize the amount of radiation exposure to normal organs.  The treatments must be given daily over several weeks because normal tissues don�t tolerate a large dosage given at one time. 
> Three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation uses a beam that goes straight through the body.  The patient�s position is changed so this beam comes through from two or three different angles.  The approach is planned to allow the maximum exposure of radiation to the tumor.
> Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses hundreds of angles to accomplish the same task.  It is far more expensive and is used when many angles are necessary.  This approach helps to spare an important organ that is not affected by the cancer.  In IMRT the intensity of the beam is varied to conform to the shape of the tumor. The aim is to limit damage to surrounding healthy tissues, while effectively treating the cancer.  IMRT is a valuable technique for treating a small percentage of cancerous tumors, but adds little value in the treatment of others.  IMRT may not be covered by your health plan unless certain criteria are met.  
>  The decision to administer radiation therapy will depend on the individual circumstances.
> Radiation can also be given internally by placing special radioactive source near a tumor (called brachytherapy), orally in the form of a pill or capsule that is swallowed, or infusion of a radioactive substance into a vein.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of cancer of the esophagus.

Lung Cancer Non-Surgical Treatments
Radiation therapy involves the use of various forms of radiation, or high-energy x-ray beams, to kill cancer cells in a specific area of the body.  It can be used to cure a cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or as an alternative to surgery.  It can also be used to decrease symptoms that are related to a tumor.  Radiation can also be given before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery to prevent cancer from returning.  It may also be used to simply relieve symptoms of a progressive cancer.  It can be given simultaneously with chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy can be given in various ways, depending on what type of cancer you have and where it is located in your body.  
> Radiation therapy to treat lung cancers can be given externally by a machine that is located outside the body.  The machine sends high energy x-ray beams to the tumor.  These beams can kill the cancer cells and result in a tumor that shrinks or even disappears.  These x-ray beams must pass through normal tissue on their way to the cancer and out of the body.  The radiation that passes through these normal organs can cause damage.  Radiation oncologists plan the treatments to minimize the amount of radiation exposure to normal organs.  The treatments must be given daily over several weeks because normal tissues don�t tolerate a large dosage given at one time. 
> Three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation uses a beam that goes straight through the body.  The patient�s position is changed so this beam comes through from two or three different angles.  The approach is planned to allow the maximum exposure of radiation to the tumor.
> Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses hundreds of angles to accomplish the same task.  It is far more expensive and is used when many angles are necessary.  This approach helps to spare an important organ that is not affected by the cancer.  In IMRT the intensity of the beam is varied to conform to the shape of the tumor. The aim is to limit damage to surrounding healthy tissues, while effectively treating the cancer.  IMRT is a valuable technique for treating a small percentage of cancerous tumors, but adds little value in the treatment of others.  IMRT may not be covered by your health plan unless certain criteria are met.

M,CR030,Biopsy - Testicles,"A testicle biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue from a testicle to check for the presence of abnormal, or cancerous, cells.  The test can also be done to examine the sperm and possibly determine the cause of a man�s infertility.  Your healthcare provider may recommend an ultrasound and biopsy of your testicles if you are having problems with infertility or have a lump on one of your testicles.  There are two different ways to do a testicle biopsy; your healthcare provider will determine which method is best for you.  Depending on the circumstances, a biopsy of the testicle can be done in a healthcare provider�s office or operating room.  
> Needle biopsy � The surgeon removes a small piece of testicle tissue through a small needle inserted into the testicle.  A medication is injected into the area to numb it prior to the biopsy.  A needle biopsy produces a very small hole in the skin of the scrotum, so there is less chance of infection or scarring.  However, the results may not be as accurate because it is possible to miss cancerous cells.  This type of biopsy is usually done in a healthcare provider�s office.   
> Incisional or open biopsy � The surgeon makes an incision in the scrotum and removes a piece of tissue from a testicle.  A medication is injected into the area to numb it prior to the biopsy.  Sutures are usually needed to close the incision.  An incisional biopsy is done through a small cut made in the skin, so there is a greater chance of infection or scarring.  However, the results are typically more accurate because there is a reduced chance the surgeon will miss cancerous cells. This type of biopsy is usually done in an operating room at a surgical center or hospital.  In some cases it can be done in an office.  
The costs for this care path are for an open biopsy, performed in an outpatient facility.

M,CR031,Cancer - Testicle Removal,"Testicular cancer refers to the growth of abnormal (malignant or cancerous) cells in one or both testicles.  The testicles are two glands that are part of the male reproductive system.  They are located in the scrotum, a sack that sits behind the penis, and their primary function is to produce sperm and testosterone (a male hormone).  The two primary types of testicular cancer (seminoma and nonseminoma) start in the cells in the testicles that make sperm.  
> Seminomas usually do not grow very fast and are usually only found in the testicles.  However, in some cases they can spread to the lymph nodes near the testicles.  This type of cancer is very sensitive to radiation and is often found in men in their 30 to 40s, but can occur in younger or older men as well.
> Nonseminoma testicular cancer is made up of different cells and tends to grow faster than seminoma cancer.  Nonseminomas are more common than seminomas and often occur in young men.

An orchiectomy, the removal of one or both of the testicles through an incision in the groin, is the primary surgical treatment for testicular cancer.  The nearby lymph nodes may also be removed at the same time as the testicle(s).  
> Removal of the testicles is done for both seminomas and nonseminomas.
> If only one testicle is removed, there should be minimal impact to your sex drive and you will still be able to father children if the other testicle is healthy.

The three main surgeries are a radical neck dissection, a selective neck dissection, and a modified neck dissection.
> A radical neck dissection is when the surgeon removes all the lymph nodes, tissue, muscles, nerves, salivary glands, and major blood vessel on the side of the neck where the cancer was found.  
> A selective neck dissection is when the surgeon only removes some of the lymph nodes from the side of the neck where the cancer was found.  It can be done if the cancer has not spread very far and may spare the nerves, blood vessels, muscle.

M,CR039,Cancer - Head or Neck - Radiation,"Head or neck cancer refers to the growth of abnormal (malignant or cancerous) cells in the head or neck, typically in the moist membranes of the nose, mouth, or throat.  These cancers frequently start in the squamous cells of the moist membranes, so they are often called squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.  The following cancers are included in the group of head and neck cancers.  
> Cancers of the mouth (oral cavity).  This includes the front of the tongue, the gums, the lining of the cheeks and lips, and the bottom and top of the mouth.
> Cancers of the throat (pharynx).  This is the tube that begins behind the nose and extends to the food pipe.   
> Cancers of the voicebox (larynx).  This is a short tube that is located at the bottom of the pharynx.
> Cancers of the sinuses and nasal cavity.  These are hollow spaces inside the head and nose.  
> Cancer of the salivary glands.  These are the glands in the floor of the mouth that produce saliva.  Cancer of the salivary glands is uncommon.    

Head or Neck Cancer Staging
Healthcare providers will look for spread of the head or neck cancer to the lymph nodes in the neck or other areas of the body.  This process is called �staging.�  
> Metastatic head or neck cancer is one of several cancers that started in the moist areas of the head or neck and has spread to the lymph nodes or other organs and tissues.  
To decide what type of surgical and non-surgical treatment is ideal for a specific head or neck cancer, your healthcare provider will need the following clinical information. 
> What does the cancer look like under the microscope?  Where is it located?
> How large is the primary cancer?
> Has the cancer spread to lymph glands or anywhere else in the body?

Head or Neck Cancer Non-Surgical Treatment
Radiation therapy involves the use of various forms of radiation, or high-energy x-ray beams, to kill cancer cells in a specific area of the body.  It can be used to cure a cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or as an alternative to surgery.  It can also be used to decrease symptoms that are related to a tumor.  Radiation can also be given before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery to prevent cancer from returning.  It may also be used to simply relieve symptoms of a progressive cancer.  It can be given simultaneously with chemotherapy.  Radiation therapy can be given in various ways, depending on what type of cancer you have and where it is located in your body.  
> Radiation therapy to treat various head or neck cancers is usually given externally by a machine that is located outside the body.  The machine sends high energy x-ray beams to the tumor, which can kill the cancer cells and result in a tumor that shrinks or even disappears.  These x-ray beams must pass through normal tissue on their way to the cancer and on their way out of the body.  The radiation that passes through these normal organs can cause damage.  Radiation oncologists plan the treatments to minimize the amount of radiation exposure to normal organs.  The treatments must be given daily over several weeks because normal tissues don�t tolerate a large dosage given at one time. 
> Radiation today is given externally using three types of technology.  Three dimensional (3D) conformal radiation uses a beam that goes straight through the body.  The patient�s position is changed so that this beam comes through from two or three different angles.  The approach is planned to allow the maximum exposure of radiation to the tumor.
> Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses hundreds of angles to accomplish the same task.  It is far more expensive and is only necessary when many angles are necessary to spare an important organ that is not affected by the cancer.  In IMRT the intensity of the beam is varied to conform to the shape of the tumor. The aim is to limit damage to surrounding healthy tissues, while effectively treating the cancer.  IMRT is a valuable technique for treating a small percentage of cancerous tumors, but adds little value in the treatment of others.  Therefore, IMRT may not be covered by your health plan unless certain criteria are met.  
> The decision to administer radiation therapy will depend on the individual circumstances.","Contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of head or neck cancer.  Be prepared to discuss your symptoms and how long you�ve had them.

M,CR041,Cancer - Prostate Removal,"Prostate cancer refers to the growth of abnormal (malignant or cancerous) cells in the prostate gland.  The prostate gland is part of the male reproductive system; it produces the fluid that carries sperm and provides them with nutrition.  It is a small gland, about the size of a walnut, and is located just below the bladder next to the rectum.  The prostate gland surrounds the tube that carries urine from the bladder (urethra), so when it enlarges it can affect a man�s ability to urinate normally.  
> The prostate gland frequently becomes enlarged in men as they grow older.  This enlargement is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  A prostate biopsy is needed to determine if enlargement is due to cancer or BPH.   
> BPH does not increase a man�s risk for prostate cancer.  
> A blood test that can be used to monitor the prostate gland is called prostate specific antigen, or PSA.

Prostate Cancer Surgical Treatments
A prostatectomy is the removal of the prostate gland and surrounding tissue, through a single large incision or several small incisions in the abdomen.  It is usually done when cancer is only found in the prostate gland and has not spread to other areas of the body.  There are 4 different ways the prostate gland can be removed.  Which type of prostatectomy your healthcare provider recommends will depend on your individual circumstances.  
> Radical retropubic prostatectomy is when the prostate is removed through a long incision that goes from the belly button to the pubic bone, just above the pubic hair line.  
> Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is when the prostate is removed using small instruments and a camera that are inserted through several small incisions in the abdomen.  
> Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy is when the prostate is removed by robotic arms that are controlled by a surgeon using a computer.  The robotic arms use small instruments and a camera that are inserted through several small incisions in the abdomen.  
> Radical perineal prostatectomy is when the prostate is removed through a small incision made between the anus and the scrotum.  There is less blood loss with this type of surgery, but there is greater risk of damage to the nerves in the area.  
After the surgery a catheter will be placed into the penis to drain urine from the bladder.  A drain may also be placed near the incision to drain excess fluid from the area.","You should contact your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of prostate cancer or want to discuss the pros and cons of prostate cancer screening.

M,CV007,Coronary Artery Disease - Heart Disease,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) occurs when the arteries that carry blood to the heart muscle become narrowed or clogged, usually due to plaque buildup in the vessel walls.  This is also called coronary heart disease (CHD), arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, or �hardening of the arteries.�  When any area of the heart muscle does not receive an adequate blood supply, the result may be pain, a heart attack, an abnormal heart rhythm or even death.  
> Certain medical conditions that can lead to plaque buildup in coronary arteries, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.  Your doctor may check for those conditions as well.  
> High blood pressure is a disorder in which the pressure of blood against the walls of your arteries is too high.  Your blood pressure is high if it is 140/90 or above most of the time.  If you have diabetes, your blood pressure is considered too high if it is above 130/80.  
> Diabetes is a disorder in which your body cannot process sugar properly.  HbA1c is a blood test that measures how well your diabetes is controlled.  If you have diabetes, ask your healthcare provider what your target HbA1c should be.  
> Cholesterol is a fat (lipid) that is found in the blood.  When your cholesterol is evaluated, there are usually measurements for the so-called bad cholesterol (LDL) and the good cholesterol (HDL).  The standard lab test to check your cholesterol includes LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and your total cholesterol.  When people have too much bad cholesterol in their blood, it can lead to increased buildup of plaque in their arteries and cause problems with circulation.","If you believe you have coronary artery disease or think you may be at risk for CAD, you should see your healthcare provider.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects).

M,CV008,Atrial Fibrillation - Heart Rhythm Evaluation,"The heart is a hollow, muscular organ with 4 chambers.  The top 2 chambers (left and right atrium) receive blood from the body and the lungs.  The bottom two chambers are called ventricles.  The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it out to the lungs.  The left ventricle receives blood from the left atrium and pumps it out to the rest of the body. The heart�s contractions are controlled by an electrical conduction system that determines the rate and rhythm of the contractions.  
> The heart's normal pacemaker initiates contractions of its four chambers in a coordinated rhythm.  A normal resting heart rate for an adult is a regular 60 to 100 beats per minute.  An arrhythmia can cause the heart to beat irregularly fast or slow.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common long-term abnormal heart rhythm.  It is an irregular heartbeat that  interferes with the heart�s ability to pump blood as effectively as it should.  Untreated, atrial fibrillation may cause a stroke.  
> Instead of normal contractions, atrial fibrillation causes the atria to �quiver.�  This can lead to blood pooling in the atria and forming clots.  When the heart contracts one of these clots, or parts of a clot, can break away and travel to other organs and tissues in the body.  If the clot goes into a blood vessel leading to the brain, it can result in a stroke.  Therefore, atrial fibrillation is often treated with a prescription blood thinner to prevent the formation of clots in the atria.
Some of the causes of atrial fibrillation include:
> excessive alcohol use 
> heart failure
> coronary artery disease 
> high blood pressure
> enlarged heart
> certain medications
> overactive thyroid gland 
> pericarditis
> heart valve disorders
However, many people with AF don�t have any of risk factors. Symptoms are not always present when someone has atrial fibrillation.  If symptoms are present, they can include palpitations, fainting, shortness of breath, and fatigue.  If you have symptoms of atrial fibrillation, you should see your health care provider right away.  Your healthcare provider will check your medical history and examine you.  A variety of tests may also be ordered to evaluate your heart.  
> An electrocardiogram (EKG) is usually the first test to detect an arrhythmia.  An EKG will reveal arrhythmias that are present at the time of the recording.  If you have symptoms that come and go, and your healthcare provider suspects that you have atrial fibrillation, a portable heart monitor may be recommended.  You will wear the monitor for anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.  This is done to pick up arrhythmias that only occasionally occur.  
> An electrophysiology study (EP study or cardiac mapping) may be done to find arrhythmias and where the abnormal electrical impulses start.  An EP study may be used in conjunction with a procedure called radiofrequency ablation to treat atrial fibrillation. This study is reserved for those persons whose AF is difficult to treat. It is generally not done on persons with newly-diagnosed AF. 
This care path includes the cost of a hospitalization, EP studies, and coronary angiogram to evaluate the heart and its electrical system.  

Atrial Fibrillation it is not immediately life-threatening, but it is serious and can cause a stroke if it is not adequately treated.  There are many different treatments for atrial fibrillation.  
> There are different medications that may be recommended to control your heart rate and rhythm.  In most cases, medication will be ordered to keep blood clots from forming.
> Cardioversion is a procedure that uses an electric shock to convert an abnormal rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation, to a normal rhythm.  (This is not the same amount of  electrical current that is given during a cardiac arrest.)  Cardioversion can also be done with medications given intravenously in the hospital. Cardioversion is usually successful in returning a person to a normal heart rhythm. However, after cardioversion atrial fibrillation may sometimes reoccur.
> Radiofrequency ablation, also called catheter ablation, is a procedure that uses
radiofrequency energy to destroy (ablate) abnormal electrical pathways.  This procedure is usually reserved for persons whose AF is difficult to treat. It is generally not done on persons with newly-diagnosed AF. 
> Surgery that involves making incisions in the atria to redirect the electrical impulses is an option if medication and other procedures do not control your atrial fibrillation. This procedure is usually reserved for persons whose AF is difficult to treat.  It is generally not done on persons with newly-diagnosed AF. 

Benefits, Risks, and More Information

Most people diagnosed with atrial fibrillation do well.  The benefits and risks of treatment for atrial fibrillation depend on the treatment.  
> Medications to control your heart rate and rhythm have different benefits and risks.  As previously noted, you may need to take a blood thinner to prevent clots from forming in your heart.  Talk to your healthcare provider about these medications, their side effects, and life style changes you will need to make.    
> Cardioversion can be an effective treatment. It is very safe.  Side effects to a cardioversion using intravenous medication vary, depending on the medication.  For both types of cardioversion, medication may still be needed to keep a normal heart rhythm.  In addition, recurring atrial fibrillation may not respond to this type of therapy.    
> Radiofrequency ablation can be effective if atrial fibrillation is caused by an �extra� pathway in the heart.  Lifelong medication is not needed and recovery time is much shorter than conventional surgery.  Risks to an ablation include perforation of a blood vessel or heart muscle, arrhythmias, blood clots, bleeding, stroke, and heart attack.  As previously noted, this procedure is usually reserved for persons whose AF is difficult to treat.  It is generally not done on persons with newly-diagnosed AF.","If you have any symptoms of atrial fibrillation, make an appointment with your healthcare provider right away.  Ask your healthcare provider the following questions.   
> Do I need any special tests?  What are the benefits and risks of having the tests?  
> Will the tests change your treatment recommendations?  If not, is there a need for them? 
> What are my treatment options and what is the best treatment for me? What are the risks of each one? 
> Do I need to take a blood thinner? For how long?  How often will I need blood work?  Are there any specials precautions or dietary restrictions I should know?
> What symptoms should I be concerned about? 
> Can my symptoms be controlled with medications?  If so, are there Tier 1 or Tier 2 medications on my Prescription Drug List that I should take?  How long will I need to take these medications?  What are the side effects of my medications? 
Prior to discharge, you should understand all home care instructions.  This includes symptoms to report before your next appointment, medications and their side effects, and follow-up plans.

M,DC005,Heart Bypass - Coronary Artery Bypass Graft,"The heart is a hollow, muscular organ with 4 chambers.  The top 2 chambers (left and right atrium) receive blood from the body and the lungs respectively.  The bottom two chambers are called ventricles.  The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it out to the lungs.  The left ventricle receives blood from the left atrium and pumps it out to the rest of the body.  Just like other muscles in our body, the heart muscle needs its own blood supply to work properly.  The arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood are called the coronary arteries.  
> The two main coronary arteries are the left and right coronary arteries.  Both the left and right coronary arteries branch off into smaller arteries.  
> When someone has coronary artery disease, he or she can develop blockages in a main coronary artery and/or in one or more of the smaller arteries that branch off from the main vessels.  The larger the coronary artery, the more heart muscle that is at risk for death if a blockage occurs.  

A standard coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is a surgery that involves taking a blood vessel (artery or vein) from the chest or other part of the body and using it to create a flow of blood around a blocked coronary artery.  Depending on the number of blockages, several blood vessels, or ""grafts,"" may be needed.
> At the start of surgery your heart may be stopped.  If your heart is stopped a heart-lung machine will be used to put oxygen into your blood and move it throughout your body.  Your surgeon will perform the necessary grafts while your heart is not moving.  Once the surgery is completed, if your heart does not start beating on its own it will be restarted with an electrical shock. ","If your healthcare provider recommends a CABG, ask the following questions:

The bottom two chambers are called ventricles.  The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it out to the lungs.  The left ventricle receives blood from the left atrium and pumps it out to the rest of the body. The heart�s contractions are controlled by an electrical conduction system that determines the rate and rhythm of the contractions.  
> The heart's normal pacemaker initiates contractions of its four chambers in a coordinated rhythm.  A normal resting heart rate for an adult is a regular 60 to 100 beats per minute.  An arrhythmia can cause the heart to beat too slow, too fast, or irregularly fast or slow.
> Electrical impulses that result in life threatening fast and irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) typically start in the ventricles.  Ventricular tachycardia is when the ventricles are beating very fast.  Ventricular fibrillation is when the ventricles beat in a fast, chaotic manner.  Both of these arrhythmias can quickly lead to a cardiac arrest.   
> An implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) may be recommended if you have survived life-threatening irregular heartbeats (sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) that are not associated with a heart attack.  It may also be recommended if you are at a high risk for cardiac arrest because you have an enlarged heart, a history of heart failure, or have had a heart attack.
�Certain congenital (present at birth) heart problems or genetic health conditions

An implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) is a device that detects life-threatening arrhythmias and delivers an electrical shock to the heart to convert the rhythm back to normal.  The symptoms you might feel when an ICD discharges depend on the arrhythmia and the electrical current that is discharged by the ICD.  You might feel nothing, a minor skipping of your heart, or like you were just kicked in the chest.  Any discomfort after the ICD discharges should be brief and resolve quickly.
> A normal heartbeat usually returns after a single shock.  If several shocks occur during a brief period, you should seek medical attention to have your heart and ICD evaluated. 

The two parts of an ICD are the leads and a generator.  The leads conduct electrical impulses from the generator to the heart muscle. 
> The generator is small and powered by a lithium battery, which lasts from 4 to 6 years.  How long the battery lasts depends on how often the ICD needs to restore your normal heart rhythm. 
> There are several types of ICDs; newer ICDs also have the ability to act as a pacemaker.  The type of ICD your healthcare provider recommends will depend on your general health, medical history, current diagnosis, and the provider�s preferences.  
> ICDs are typically inserted just below the collarbone, in the soft tissue outside the ribs. They can later be analyzed and programmed electronically. 
> ICDs may also be used to treat atrial fibrillation, heart failure, a heart attack that has weakened your heart, an enlarged heart, or an inherited heart defect that makes your heart beat abnormally (such as long QT syndrome).","If your healthcare provider recommends an ICD, ask him or her the following questions.  
> Do I need any special tests?  What are the benefits and risks of having the tests?  
> Will the tests change your treatment recommendations?  If not, is there a need for them?

M,DC007,Heart Valve Replacement,"The heart is a hollow, muscular organ with 4 chambers.  The top 2 chambers (left and right atrium) receive blood from the body and the lungs respectively.  The bottom 2 chambers are called ventricles.  The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it out to the lungs.  The left ventricle receives blood from the left atrium and pumps it out to the rest of the body. There are four one-way valves in the heart that help direct and regulate blood flow through the heart.  These are the tricuspid, aortic, mitral, and pulmonic valves.
> The tricuspid valve controls the blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. 
> The pulmonic valve controls the blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, which carries blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. 
> The mitral valve controls blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. 
> The aortic valve controls the blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta, which carries blood out to the body. 
Heart valve disorders are usually divided into two types.  Stenosis is narrowing of a valve, which causes a decreased flow of blood through the narrowed space.  Regurgitation occurs when a valve does not close completely, leading to a backward flow of blood through the valve.   

Replacement of a damaged heart valve to treat stenosis or regurgitation is usually done using open-heart surgery.  A damaged valve can be replaced with a biological valve (a human valve or a valve made from pig or cow tissue).  It may also be replaced with a mechanical valve (made from metal and carbon).  Biological valves may also contain some artificial parts. 
> At the start of surgery your heart may be stopped.  If your heart is stopped a heart-lung machine will be used to put oxygen into your blood and move it throughout your body.  Your surgeon will perform the valve replacement while your heart is not moving.  Once the surgery is completed, if your heart does not start beating on its own it will be restarted with an electrical shock. 
> Newer, less invasive surgeries (such as a procedure that replaces the valve through a catheter while the heart is still beating), may be an alternative for people who are not good candidates for traditional open heart surgery.
> In some cases, a damaged valve may be repaired instead of being replaced.  This is most commonly the case with the mitral and tricuspid valves, which are not operated on as often.","If your healthcare provider recommends a valve replacement, ask the following questions.  
> What's wrong with my heart valve and which valve is affected?  Are there any alternatives to surgery?  Why are you recommending one treatment over another?

M,DM001,Diabetes ,"Diabetes occurs when the levels of a type of sugar (glucose) rises in the blood to certain levels.  This occurs when there is a lack of insulin or when the insulin that is present is less effective than it should be and is insufficient to meet the body�s needs.  The ability to process glucose, or use it for energy, depends on the body being able to produce and use insulin.  Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas; its job is to move glucose from the blood into cells in certain tissue so the glucose can be used for energy.  When the body does not produce enough insulin, or is unable to effectively use the insulin that is produced (insulin resistance), increased levels of glucose result.  There are 3 main types of diabetes; type 1 diabetes (previously called juvenile onset diabetes), type 2 diabetes (previously called adult onset diabetes), and gestational diabetes (diabetes occurring during pregnancy).   
> Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body makes very little or no insulin.  In order for the body to use glucose for energy, and keep blood sugars under control, daily insulin injections are needed.  This type of diabetes is usually diagnosed in younger people (children, teens, or young adults), and often appears to have an acute or quick onset.  
> Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body does not make enough insulin and/or is unable to effectively use the insulin it does make (insulin resistance).  Often, certain medications taken by mouth can help the body release more insulin or help the body use it more effectively.  However, some people with type 2 diabetes will require insulin injections.  This type of diabetes is usually diagnosed in middle aged or older people, but is becoming more common in younger people due to the increase in obesity and sedentary lifestyles.  The symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly and are rarely severe at the start.  Therefore, people often do not know they have this condition.  
> Gestational diabetes occurs when a non-diabetic woman develops high blood sugar levels during her pregnancy.  This condition can lead to complications with the pregnancy and requires careful management to help ensure the best possible outcome for mother and child.  Some women who have gestational diabetes eventually develop Type 2 diabetes.  Therefore, those women need periodic surveillance even when they are not pregnant.","If you believe you have diabetes, you should see your healthcare provider.

M,HR004,Hiatal Hernia Repair,"The esophagus is a tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.  The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen.  The esophagus goes through the diaphragm through a small opening called the hiatus.  Hiatal hernias can occur when the muscle that supports the hiatus has a weakness that allows a part of the stomach to protrude up through the hiatus.  There are two types of hiatal hernias.  One is the sliding hiatal hernia, which often goes undetected or remains uncomplicated. The other is the paraesophageal hernia, which is an excessively large hiatal hernia.  A paraesophageal hernia is less common, but more likely to lead to complications.

When the blood supply to the part of the stomach that is incarcerated is affected, the condition is called a strangulated hernia.  A strangulated hernia is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgery.

One of the  surgical procedures used to repair a hiatal hernia is called a Nissen fundoplication.  During this surgery, the stomach is put back into its natural place and the weakness in the hiatus is repaired with sutures.  To reduce acid reflux (backflow of acid into the esophagus), the upper part of the stomach is wrapped around the base of the esophagus.
> A Nissen fundoplication can be done through an incision in the abdomen or chest, or through a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a thin, flexible tube with a camera and light on the end.

> Stress urinary incontinence happens when a sneeze, cough, laugh, exercise, or any other activity puts pressure on the bladder and causes urine to leak.  It is the most common type of incontinence, particularly among women.  

A sling operation is a surgical procedure that involves using a strip of man-made material or human tissue to support the bladder and urethra.  It typically involves making one incision in the abdomen and one small incision in the vagina.  
> The strip is inserted through the vagina. Then it is placed behind the spot where the urethra connects to the bottom of the bladder (called the bladder neck).  It is tightened and anchored into place through the incision in the abdomen.  The sling acts as a hammock for the bladder and helps keep the bladder and urethra in their correct position.

M,LI002,Glaucoma - Eye Shunt,"Glaucoma is an eye disease that can damage the optic nerve.  Normally, a clear fluid called aqueous humor flows into the eye and nourishes the tissues in the eye.  It drains out of the eye through a special drainage system called the trabecular meshwork. 
> Glaucoma is the buildup of the aqueous humor in the eye, usually due to problems with drainage.  As the fluid builds up, the pressure inside the eye increases.  This increased pressure can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss.  Other eye structures can also be damaged.  
> Once nerve cells are destroyed and vision is lost, the damage is permanent. 
There are many different types of glaucoma.  The four most common types are primary open-angle glaucoma (most common), angle-closure glaucoma (acute or chronic), secondary glaucoma (due to injury, inflammation, steroid use, or eye surgery), and congenital glaucoma (appears soon after birth).

A trabeculectomy is a type of surgical procedure that gives the fluid in the eye another way to drain.  It involves making a small incision in the sclera (white part of the eye) and removing a piece of the trabecular meshwork.  An opening may also be made in the iris (round structure that surrounds the pupil) so the fluid can drain out and form a small blister or �bleb.�  The blood vessels in the eye then absorb the fluid or �bleb.�  
> Prescription medications are used during surgery to prevent bleb failure, which can be caused by scarring that occurs as the wound heals.
> In certain cases, drainage implant surgery and placement of a special shunt may be recommended.  With this surgery, a drainage device and tiny tube (shunt) are inserted into the eye to provide a passageway for excess fluid.  As with a trabeculectomy, the fluid that drains out of the device is absorbed by the blood vessels in the eye.","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having glaucoma surgery?

Testosterone is a hormone that is important for male growth and development, as well as the maintenance of some of the body�s important tissues and functions (e.g., bone and muscle mass, the production of red blood cells and sperm, and regulation of a man�s sex drive).  This care path focuses on low testosterone that occurs during adulthood.     
> Primary hypogonadism (low functioning of the genital organs) usually results from conditions directly affecting the testes, such as certain infections and genetic conditions.
> Secondary hypogonadism is a problem with the parts of the brain that send signals to the testes to make more testosterone.  Secondary hypogonadism can occur because of disorders involving the pituitary gland (the so-called master gland), various inflammatory diseases, HIV/AIDS, medications and, obesity.

M,PP001,Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease related to rheumatoid arthritis. There are five different types of psoriasis; they are erythrodermic, guttate, inverse, pustular, and plaque.  The most common type of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis.  Plaque psoriasis is a chronic condition characterized by skin that is red, thick, and covered with patchy areas that are silver or white in color.  The patches are called scales.  What causes psoriasis is not clear, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease (where the body attacks itself) that causes skin cells to reproduce too rapidly.  This results in a buildup of dead skin cells on the surface of the skin, causing the scales or patchy areas seen with plaque psoriasis.  
> Although psoriasis can develop anywhere on the body, some areas where it is typically seen include the knees, elbows, and torso; the scalp and nails can also be affected. 
> The symptoms of psoriasis can vary from mild (a few small spots) to severe (patches that cover large areas of skin) and go away completely for long periods of time. 
> Some people with psoriasis develop a specific type of arthritis, known as �psoriatic arthritis.�  The symptoms associated with psoriatic arthritis can range from mild to severe and can affect different joints in the body.  Mild symptoms commonly affect the joints at the end of the toes and fingers; more severe symptoms can affect the spine, especially the lower (lumbar) spine area.

M,RA001,Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder, which occurs when the body's immune system reacts against its own tissues.  This results in inflammation and damage of the tissues in and around the joints.  RA is a very different condition than the more common osteoarthritis.  It can be accompanied by other medical conditions caused by the same autoimmune reaction.  The inflammation associated with RA can cause significant pain, deformity, and disability.  Although the exact cause of RA is not known, risk for developing the condition is increased by such factors as:
> age (risk increases with age)
> sex (females have an increased risk)
> genetics (presence of certain genetic markers)
If someone is at increased risk for RA (e.g., has certain genetic markers) then certain triggers, such as an infection, may trigger the development of the condition.
","The outcome for people diagnoses with rheumatoid arthritis depends on how severe the symptoms are and how well the disease is controlled.  In time, other body systems can also be affected and lead to, among others:
> lung and heart problems 
> osteoporosis (loss of bone)
> eye problems (especially dry eyes)
> hepatitis (inflammation in the liver)
> ulcers of the skin
> depression and anxiety
In order to prevent these complications it is important that you follow your healthcare provider�s instructions and keep your RA symptoms under control.  The medications prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis can have significant side effects that may affect your recovery.  It is important to remember that treatment is usually prescribed when it is felt that the benefits will significantly outweigh the risks.

M,VH001,Hepatitis B - Office Visit,"Hepatitis is the medical term for inflammation of the liver.  Hepatitis B is a preventable viral infection of the liver, which can lead to liver disease that gets worse over time.  In some people who develop hepatitis B, their immune system is able to eliminate the virus and cure the disease.  In others, their immune system is not able to eliminate the virus (becomes chronic).  This can lead to serious long-term complications, such as scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) and liver cancer.  Hepatitis B is more likely to become a chronic condition if you are infected at an early age.
> Hepatitis B is caused by a virus (HBV) that infects the liver cell.  The HBV is found in the blood and other body fluids of infected people. 
> Thanks to immunization programs, hepatitis B infection can be prevented; the overall incidence of the infection has dropped.  
> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all children get their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and complete the vaccine series by 18 months of age.  Children and adolescents through 18 years of age who have not received the vaccine, as well as adults with risks factors for contracting the virus, should also be vaccinated.  ","If you believe you may have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus, or have symptoms of hepatitis B, see your healthcare provider.
> Before your appointment, make a list of your medical history, including past illnesses, surgeries and hospitalizations; your medications (including over-the-counter); and any questions or concerns you want to discuss.
> During your appointment, ask about your overall health, what symptoms you might have, when you may start to see improvement; what the follow-up plans are, if any; and what symptoms you should report before your next appointment.
> After your appointment, you should know your diagnosis, what tests you might need, the reason for those tests, and if the test results will change your treatment plan.  You should also understand your treatment plan, any possible alternatives, and what medications are recommended (including possible side effects). 
> Depending upon the results of your medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, your health care professional may refer you to a physician who specializes in the treatment of hepatitis B.
> If your healthcare provider prescribes a medication for you, ask for a generic version.  If your doctor thinks that a generic version is not right for you, ask for a medication on the lowest available tier of your Prescription Drug List (PDL).

M,VY001,Vasectomy - Male Sterilization,"A vasectomy is considered a permanent procedure to create male sterility.  It involves cutting and blocking the tubes that carry sperm (vas deferens).   This prevents sperm from leaving a man�s body and possibly resulting in a pregnancy.  The vas deferens can be cut through an incision in the scrotum, made by a scalpel, or through a puncture wound in the scrotum that doesn�t involve a scalpel incision.  After a vasectomy a man will continue to make semen, but because there should be no sperm present, pregnancy will usually not occur.  However, it is important to note that this is considered a permanent method of preventing pregnancy. Also, it should be noted that under very rare circumstances, a pregnancy may occur after a vasectomy.
> The testicles are two glands that are part of the male reproductive system.  They are located in the scrotum, a sack that sits behind the penis.  Their primary function is to produce sperm and testosterone (a male hormone.)
> The vas deferens allows the sperm to go from the testicles to the urethra, where they are eliminated from the body during sexual activity.  After a vasectomy, usually no sperm are able to leave the testicles and result in pregnancy. 
> Seminal fluid, which is released during ejaculation, is made in the prostate gland to nourish and carry the sperm.  The body will continue to make seminal fluid after a vasectomy, but the fluid will not contain any sperm. ","What should I ask my healthcare provider before having a vasectomy?
> What are the pros and cons of the procedure?

M,WS001,Carpal Tunnel Surgery,"The carpal tunnel is a space that is formed by wrist bones (carpal bones) and a wrist-supporting ligament that sits on top of the bones (transverse carpal ligament).  Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) develops when the median nerve, which runs inside the carpal tunnel, becomes compressed or squeezed.  This pressure can lead to numbness, tingling, pain, and other symptoms in the hand and forearm. 
> An open carpal tunnel release involves making an incision in the palm of the hand and cutting the transverse carpal ligament.  This releases the pressure on the median nerve.  
> Endoscopic carpal tunnel release involves the surgeon making a tiny incision in your wrist and using a small tube with a camera to cut the transverse carpal ligament.  Although the recovery is faster with the endoscopic approach, there is a greater chance of nerve injury during an endoscopic release.  However, with a surgeon who has had lots of experience during endoscopic surgery, the risk is exceedingly small.
